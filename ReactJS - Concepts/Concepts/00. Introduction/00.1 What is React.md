# INTRODUCTION TO REACT

---

## 1. Problem React Was Created To Solve

Before React, developers used:

* Plain HTML + CSS + JavaScript
* jQuery for DOM manipulation

This caused:

* Manual DOM updates
* Complex state handling
* Spaghetti code
* Slow performance
* UI bugs due to sync issues

Example problem:
You change data → UI does NOT update automatically.

So developers had to:

```
Find DOM element → Update innerHTML → Handle side effects → Ensure consistency
```

This was painful and error-prone.

---

## 2. What is React?

React is:

> A JavaScript library for building fast, scalable, component-based user interfaces using a declarative approach.

Key ideas:

* UI = function of state
* Component-based architecture
* Automatic DOM updates
* Virtual DOM for performance

React only focuses on:
✅ View Layer (UI)

---

## 3. Why React is Needed

Traditional Way:

```
Data changes → You manually update UI
```

React Way:

```
Data changes → React updates UI automatically
```

So developer only focuses on:

* What UI should look like
* Not how to update it

---

## 4. React Core Philosophy

React follows 4 main principles:

1. Component-Based
2. Declarative UI
3. State Driven Rendering
4. Virtual DOM Optimization

---

## 5. How React Works (Overview)

```
State Changes
      ↓
Component Re-renders
      ↓
Virtual DOM Updated
      ↓
Diff Algorithm Runs
      ↓
Real DOM Updated Efficiently
```

You don’t touch the DOM directly.
React handles everything.

## 6. Basic React Project Structure

Standard setup:

```
react-app/
│
├── public/
│   └── index.html
│
├── src/
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── main.jsx
│   └── components/
│       └── Welcome.jsx
│
└── package.json
```

---

## 7. Simple React Example (Hello React)

### src/components/Welcome.jsx

```jsx
// Welcome.jsx
// First simple React component

function Welcome() {
  return <h2>Hello, Welcome to React</h2>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

---

### src/App.jsx

```jsx
import Welcome from "./components/Welcome";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React Introduction</h1>
      <Welcome />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

### src/main.jsx

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <App />
);
```

---

## 8. How This Example Works

1. Browser loads index.html
2. React mounts inside `#root`
3. App component is rendered
4. App renders Welcome component
5. UI appears on screen

Flow:

```
main.jsx → App → Welcome → UI
```

## 9. What Makes React Different

| Feature         | Traditional JS | React     |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| DOM Handling    | Manual         | Automatic |
| Reusability     | Poor           | Excellent |
| Code Structure  | Scattered      | Organized |
| Performance     | Slower         | Optimized |
| Maintainability | Hard           | Easy      |

## 10. Summary

| Concept     | Explanation                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| React       | UI library by Meta            |
| Goal        | Simplify UI development       |
| Core Idea   | UI updates based on data      |
| Method      | Component-driven architecture |
| Performance | Virtual DOM based             |

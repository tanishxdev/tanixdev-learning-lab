# **10.1 WHAT IS RENDERING in React?**

---

# 1. SIMPLE EXPLANATION: What is Rendering?

Rendering in React means:

> Turning your component into UI (HTML) based on the **current state and props**.

Think of React like this:

```
State + Props → React Component → JSX → Browser UI
```

Whenever something changes, React **re-runs the component function** to generate the new UI.

---

# 2. FIRST IMPORTANT FACT

> React rendering does NOT directly update the browser.

Instead React:

1. Re-runs your component function
2. Creates a new virtual DOM
3. Compares new and old virtual DOM
4. Updates only the changed parts

This process is called **Reconciliation** (We will cover it later).

---

# 3. Why understanding rendering is important?

Because:

* Your app becomes faster
* You can prevent unnecessary re-renders
* You can write clean, scalable React code
* You understand why React behaves the way it does

Most beginners DO NOT understand rendering, so they make:
❌ performance issues
❌ unnecessary computations
❌ infinite loops
❌ wrong useEffect usage

You will NOT face these issues once you master this topic.

# 4. RENDERING ≠ RE-RENDERING

### Rendering:

Happens when component appears the first time.

### Re-rendering:

Happens when component is run again because state or props changed.

# 5. Example: Basic Rendering

We will create a simple component to show when rendering happens.

Create folder:

```
src/components/10.RenderingDeepDive/Render1_Basic.jsx
```

Add this:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

function Render1_Basic() {

  console.log("Render: Component is rendering");

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Mount: Component mounted");
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Render 1: Basic Rendering</h3>
      <p>Open console to see logs</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Render1_Basic;
```

---

# 6. Add in App.jsx to view output:

```jsx
import Render1_Basic from "./components/10.RenderingDeepDive/Render1_Basic";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Render1_Basic />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

# 7. What you will see in console:

```
Render: Component is rendering
Mount: Component mounted
```

---

# 8. Key Concept Learned Today

* Rendering happens on initial load
* React runs component function each time it renders
* `console.log` inside function = logs on every render
* `useEffect([], [])` = runs only when mounted

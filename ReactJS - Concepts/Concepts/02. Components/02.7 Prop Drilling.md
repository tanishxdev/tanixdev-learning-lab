# PROP DRILLING

(Problem → Concept → Folder → Code → Explanation → Solution Path)

---

## 1. Problem That Creates Prop Drilling

Props work perfectly between:

* Parent → Child

But problem starts when data must go through many layers.

Example flow:

```
App → Parent → Child → GrandChild → ComponentX
```

You are forced to pass the same prop again and again even if the middle components DO NOT need it.

This causes:

* Unnecessary prop passing
* Messy component hierarchy
* Tight coupling
* Hard maintenance
* Poor scalability

This problem is called:

> Prop Drilling

---

## 2. What is Prop Drilling?

Prop Drilling is:

> The process of passing data through multiple components just to reach a deeply nested child.

The middle components act as **data pipes**, not actual users of the data.

---

## 3. Real-World Intuition

Think of this situation:

You want to send a message from:
CEO → Manager → Team Lead → Employee

But only Employee needs it.
Manager and Team Lead are forced to forward it.

That forced forwarding = Prop Drilling.

---

## 4. Visual Example of Problem

```
<App>
  <Parent>
    <Child>
      <DeepChild />
    </Child>
  </Parent>
</App>
```

Only DeepChild needs `userName`,
but all components receive it.

---

## 5. Folder Structure

```
src/
  components/
    Parent.jsx
    Child.jsx
    DeepChild.jsx
  App.jsx
  main.jsx
```

---

## 6. Code Demonstrating Prop Drilling

### A. App.jsx (Source of Data)

```jsx
import Parent from "./components/Parent";

function App() {
  const userName = "Tanish";

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Prop Drilling Example</h1>
      <Parent userName={userName} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

### B. Parent.jsx

```jsx
import Child from "./Child";

function Parent({ userName }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Parent Component</h2>
      <Child userName={userName} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Parent;
```

---

### C. Child.jsx (Does not need data but passes it)

```jsx
import DeepChild from "./DeepChild";

function Child({ userName }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Child Component</h3>
      <DeepChild userName={userName} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Child;
```

---

### D. DeepChild.jsx (Actual data user)

```jsx
function DeepChild({ userName }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>Deep Child Component</h4>
      <p>Received User: {userName}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default DeepChild;
```

---

## 7. What is Happening Here

Only DeepChild needs `userName`,
but Parent and Child are forced to forward it.

This chain forwarding is:
✅ Prop Drilling

---

## 8. Why Prop Drilling Is Bad

| Problem                  | Result                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Unnecessary data passing | Messy code            |
| High coupling            | Tight dependency      |
| Poor readability         | Hard debugging        |
| Poor scalability         | Difficult refactoring |

---

## 9. When Prop Drilling Becomes Dangerous

If structure becomes:

```
App → A → B → C → D → E → F → Target
```

You must pass same prop through all 7 layers.
One mistake breaks entire chain.

---

## 10. How To Solve Prop Drilling

Main solution:
✅ Context API
✅ Redux (for very large apps)

These allow:

* Global data access
* No need of chain passing
* Direct data consumption

---

## 11. Comparison

| Without Prop Drilling | With Prop Drilling  |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Direct data access    | Multiple forwarding |
| Clean architecture    | Messy chain         |
| Flexible              | Rigid               |

## 12. Summary

| Concept       | Explanation                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Prop Drilling | Passing props through unnecessary levels |
| Cause         | Deep component nesting                   |
| Problem       | Maintenance complexity                   |
| Solution      | Context API / Redux                      |

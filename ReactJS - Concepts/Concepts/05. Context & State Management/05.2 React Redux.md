# REACT REDUX

(Advanced Global State Management)

Problem → Concept → Architecture → Folder Structure → Code → Working → When to use

---

## 1. Problem Redux Solves

We already saw:

* Props → Data passing
* Prop Drilling → Too many layers
* Context API → Solves drilling but struggles with large, complex state

In big applications, Context API starts causing:

* Performance issues
* Uncontrolled re-renders
* Difficult debugging
* No proper state history
* Hard state predictability

We need:

* Centralised control
* Predictable data flow
* Debugging capability
* Scalable architecture

This is where Redux comes in.

---

## 2. What is Redux?

Redux is:

> A predictable state container for JavaScript applications.

In React context:
Redux is used to:

* Store application-wide data in a single global store
* Control how data changes using strict rules

---

## 3. Core Philosophy of Redux

Redux follows 3 strict rules:

1. Single Source of Truth
   → Entire app state lives in ONE store.

2. State is Read-Only
   → You cannot modify state directly.

3. Changes via Pure Functions
   → State changes only through reducers.

---

## 4. How Redux Architecture Works

```
Component
   ↓ dispatch(action)
Action
   ↓
Reducer
   ↓ produces new state
Store updates
   ↓
Component re-renders
```

Everything flows in ONE direction.

## 5. Redux Key Terms (Very Important)

| Term     | Meaning                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Store    | Central data container          |
| Action   | Object describing what happened |
| Reducer  | Function that updates state     |
| Dispatch | Method to send action           |
| Selector | Used to access state            |

---

## 6. Visual Data Flow

```
UI → dispatch → action → reducer → store → UI update
```

No shortcuts, no direct mutations.

---

## 7. Folder Structure (Redux Setup)

```
src/
  redux/
    store.js
    counterSlice.js
  components/
    Counter.jsx
  App.jsx
  main.jsx
```

We’ll use modern Redux Toolkit (recommended).

---

## 8. Install Required Packages

Run:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

---

## 9. Step-by-Step Redux Implementation

### STEP 1: Create Slice (Reducer + Action)

**src/redux/counterSlice.js**

```javascript
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

// Initial state
const initialState = {
  value: 0
};

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    }
  }
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

This file creates:

* State
* Actions
* Reducer logic

---

### STEP 2: Create Store

**src/redux/store.js**

```javascript
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "./counterSlice";

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer
  }
});

export default store;
```

This is the global brain of the app.

---

### STEP 3: Provide Store To React

**src/main.jsx**

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import App from "./App";
import store from "./redux/store";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);
```

Now Redux is available everywhere.

---

### STEP 4: Use Redux State in Component

**src/components/Counter.jsx**

```jsx
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { increment, decrement } from "../redux/counterSlice";

function Counter() {

  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Redux Counter</h2>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>

      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>
        +
      </button>

      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>
        -
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

---

### STEP 5: Show in App.jsx

**src/App.jsx**

```jsx
import Counter from "./components/Counter";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React Redux Example</h1>
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

## 10. How Redux Works Internally

When you click +:

1. dispatch(increment)
2. Action sent to reducer
3. Reducer updates store
4. useSelector reads new value
5. Component re-renders

Pure predictable flow.

## 11. Redux vs Context API

| Feature              | Context API       | Redux              |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Best for             | Small/medium apps | Large applications |
| Debugging            | Limited           | Excellent          |
| Scalability          | Medium            | High               |
| Middleware           | No                | Yes                |
| State predictability | Medium            | Very High          |

---

## 12. When To Use Redux

Use Redux when:

* Complex app state
* Many interacting components
* Large production apps
* Multiple data sources
* Need undo/redo or logging

Avoid Redux for:

* Small apps
* Simple UI state

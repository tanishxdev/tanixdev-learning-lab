# 12.7 REACT HOOK FORM

This is the form library used by:

* Startups
* Large companies
* E-commerce sites
* Admin dashboards
* SaaS products

Because:

* It is extremely fast
* It avoids unnecessary re-renders
* It scales to very large forms
* It integrates perfectly with Yup
* It reduces code by 70 percent
* It works with controlled & uncontrolled components

By the end of this topic, you will be able to build:

* Login
* Signup
* Multi-step forms
* Address forms
* Payment forms
* File upload forms

All in a highly optimized, professional way.

We will go slowly and clearly.

# 1. Why React Hook Form Exists

Controlled forms in React:

* Re-render on every keystroke
* Become slow in large forms
* Require lots of state code
* Need manual validation
* Have complex error handling

React Hook Form fixes all of this.

It uses **uncontrolled components internally** and accesses values through refs.

This gives massive performance benefits.

---

# 2. Install React Hook Form

Run:

```
npm install react-hook-form
```

---

# 3. The Core Idea (Very Important)

React Hook Form provides:

1. **register** → connects input to form
2. **handleSubmit** → handles submission
3. **formState.errors** → gives validation errors
4. **watch** → lets you observe inputs
5. **reset** → clears or sets values

All without re-rendering on every keystroke.

---

# 4. Basic Example: Simple Form

Create file:

`RHF1_Basic.jsx`

```jsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

export default function RHF1_Basic() {
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log("Form Data:", data);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <h3>React Hook Form (Basic)</h3>

      <input
        {...register("name")}
        placeholder="Name"
      />

      <input
        {...register("email")}
        placeholder="Email"
      />

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

This form has:

* No useState
* No re-renders
* No manual onChange handlers

Very clean.

---

# 5. Adding Validation (Built-in)

React Hook Form supports validation directly inside register.

`RHF2_WithValidation.jsx`

```jsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

export default function RHF2_WithValidation() {
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors }
  } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log("Valid Data:", data);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <h3>RHF with Validation</h3>

      <input
        {...register("email", {
          required: "Email is required",
          pattern: {
            value: /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/,
            message: "Invalid email format"
          }
        })}
        placeholder="Email"
      />
      {errors.email && (
        <p style={{ color: "red" }}>{errors.email.message}</p>
      )}

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Validation is now extremely easy.

---

# 6. Integrating Yup (Professional Setup)

Install:

```
npm install @hookform/resolvers yup
```

Create schema:

`schemas/signupSchema.js`

```jsx
import * as Yup from "yup";

export const signupSchema = Yup.object({
  name: Yup.string().required("Name required"),
  email: Yup.string().email("Invalid email").required("Email required"),
  password: Yup.string().min(8, "Min 8 characters")
});
```

Now use it:

`RHF3_YupIntegration.jsx`

```jsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { yupResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/yup";
import { signupSchema } from "./schemas/signupSchema";

export default function RHF3_YupIntegration() {
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors }
  } = useForm({
    resolver: yupResolver(signupSchema)
  });

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log("Valid Data:", data);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <h3>RHF with Yup Validation</h3>

      <input {...register("name")} placeholder="Name" />
      {errors.name && <p style={{ color: "red" }}>{errors.name.message}</p>}

      <input {...register("email")} placeholder="Email" />
      {errors.email && <p style={{ color: "red" }}>{errors.email.message}</p>}

      <input {...register("password")} type="password" placeholder="Password" />
      {errors.password && (
        <p style={{ color: "red" }}>{errors.password.message}</p>
      )}

      <button type="submit">Create Account</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

This is the recommended validation setup in almost all companies.

# 7. Example: Login Form (Very Real)

`RHF4_Login.jsx`

```jsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

export default function RHF4_Login() {
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors }
  } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log("Login Data:", data);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <h3>Login</h3>

      <input
        {...register("email", { required: "Email required" })}
        placeholder="Email"
      />
      {errors.email && <p style={{ color: "red" }}>{errors.email.message}</p>}

      <input
        {...register("password", { required: "Password required" })}
        type="password"
        placeholder="Password"
      />
      {errors.password && (
        <p style={{ color: "red" }}>{errors.password.message}</p>
      )}

      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Easy. Clean. Fast.

# 8. Example: Multi-step Form (Common in companies)

We will build this later fully, but the idea is:

* Step 1: Name + Email
* Step 2: Address
* Step 3: Payment

React Hook Form handles this cleanly with state persistence.

---

# 9. Why React Hook Form is the best form solution

Because:

1. Zero re-renders on typing
2. Very fast for large forms
3. Built-in validation
4. Excellent integration with Yup
5. Small bundle size
6. Best developer experience
7. Most popular form library in React ecosystem

Controlled forms cannot match this level of speed.

---

# 10. Summary of React Hook Form

You learned:

* Registering fields
* Handling submit
* Using built-in validation
* Integrating with Yup
* Implementing login & signup
* Understanding why RHF is extremely fast

This completes the RHF basics.

# ADVANCED KEYS

---

## 1. Problem With Poor / Incorrect Keys

Most beginners use:

```jsx
key={index}
```

This causes serious bugs when:

* Items are added
* Items are removed
* List order changes
* Dynamic updates happen

Issues caused:

* Wrong item updates
* UI flickering
* Incorrect component reuse
* Performance drops
* State mixing between list items

React may think an item is same when it is not.

---

## 2. Core Concept

Keys are:

> Unique identifiers that help React track list elements between renders.

Advanced keys mean:

* Using real unique IDs
* Not array index
* Stable and consistent values
* Proper identity tracking

React depends heavily on keys for reconciliation.

---

## 3. Real-World Intuition

Think of students in class:

Wrong tracking:
Student 1, Student 2, Student 3 (by position)

Correct tracking:
Roll Number 101, 102, 103

If a student leaves, position changes — but roll number remains correct.

Keys = Roll Number system.

---

## 4. Folder Structure

```
src/
  components/
    AdvancedKeys.jsx
  App.jsx
  main.jsx
```

---

## 5. Code Implementation

### A. Incorrect Key Usage (Bad Practice)

```jsx
{users.map((user, index) => (
  <li key={index}>{user.name}</li>
))}
```

Problems:

* If data changes, React mismatches items.

---

### B. Correct Advanced Key Usage

**src/components/AdvancedKeys.jsx**

```jsx
// AdvancedKeys.jsx
// Demonstrates correct use of unique keys.

function AdvancedKeys() {

  const users = [
    { id: "u1", name: "Tanish" },
    { id: "u2", name: "Rahul" },
    { id: "u3", name: "Amit" }
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Advanced Keys Example</h2>

      <ul>
        {users.map(user => (
          <li key={user.id}>
            {user.name}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default AdvancedKeys;
```

Explanation:

* Each user has unique `id`
* React can now correctly identify each element

---

### C. Use in App.jsx

**src/App.jsx**

```jsx
import AdvancedKeys from "./components/AdvancedKeys";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Advanced Keys Concept</h1>
      <AdvancedKeys />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## 6. How React Uses Keys Internally

During re-render:

1. Old list exists
2. New list generated
3. React compares keys
4. Finds what changed
5. Updates only required nodes

Without proper keys:
React guesses → Causes wrong updates

---

## 7. Example Scenario

Before Update:

```
Tanish
Rahul
Amit
```

Insert new user at top:

```
Riya
Tanish
Rahul
Amit
```

If using index as key:

* React thinks items shifted
* Updates wrong DOM nodes

If using id key:

* React knows exactly where to update

## 8. Rules for Good Keys

| Rule             | Why                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Must be unique   | Identification            |
| Must be stable   | No change between renders |
| No random values | Avoid Math.random()       |
| No array index   | Breaks order logic        |

---

## 9. Common Mistakes

❌ `key={Math.random()}`
❌ `key={index}`
❌ `key={Date.now()}`

✅ `key={user.id}`
✅ `key={item.uuid}`
✅ `key={orderNumber}`

---

## 10. Why Advanced Keys Matter

| Problem            | Advanced Keys Solution |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Wrong UI updates   | Accurate diffing       |
| Performance issues | Optimized rendering    |
| Component bugs     | Correct mapping        |
| Broken state       | Stable state handling  |

## 11. Summary

| Concept       | Explanation                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Advanced Keys | Proper unique identifiers for lists |
| Goal          | Accurate rendering                  |
| Requirement   | Stable + Unique                     |
| Result        | Bug-free list rendering             |

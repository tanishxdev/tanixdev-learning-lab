## **Article 1: Understanding Mapping Cardinality in Database Relationships**



### **1. Overview**

**Cardinality** in Database Management Systems (DBMS) represents **the number of times an entity from one entity set participates in a relationship set**.  
In simpler terms:  
> **Cardinality defines how many rows in one table are related to rows in another table.**

It is a **fundamental concept in Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling** and directly impacts:
* Database design
* Normalization
* Query performance
* Data integrity

---

### **2. What is Mapping Cardinality?**

**Mapping Cardinality (or Cardinality Ratio)** specifies **how entities in one set are linked to entities in another set** through a relationship.

It answers the question:  
> *"How many instances of entity B can be associated with one instance of entity A?"*

Primarily used in **binary relationships**, but applicable to complex ones too.

---

### **3. Types of Cardinality**

There are **four main types** of mapping cardinality:

| Type            | Notation (A → B)         | Meaning |
|-----------------|--------------------------|--------|
| **One-to-One**      | 1:1                     | One entity in A → At most one in B |
| **One-to-Many**     | 1:N                     | One in A → Many in B |
| **Many-to-One**     | N:1                     | Many in A → One in B |
| **Many-to-Many**    | M:N                     | Many in A → Many in B |

> **Note:** `Many-to-One` is essentially the **reverse view** of `One-to-Many`.

---

### **4. Detailed Explanation with Examples**

#### **A. One-to-One (1:1)**


* One entity in **A** is associated with **at most one** entity in **B**, and vice versa.

**Example:**  
> **Person ↔ Passport**  
One person has exactly one passport. One passport belongs to one person.

**Use Case:**  
* Employee ↔ Office Cabin  
* Student ↔ Scholarship (if unique)

>  Example: In a particular hospital, the surgeon department has one head of department. They both serve one-to-one relationships.

---

#### **B. One-to-Many (1:N)**

* One entity in **A** can be associated with **multiple** entities in **B**, but one in **B** links to **only one** in **A**.

**Example:**  
> **Department → Employees**  
One department has many employees. Each employee belongs to one department.

**Use Case:**  
* Author → Books  
* Customer → Orders

---

#### **C. Many-to-One (N:1)**

* Multiple entities in **A** relate to **one** entity in **B**.

> This is just the **reverse perspective** of One-to-Many.

**Example:**  
> **Employees → Department**  
Many employees work in one department.

*(Same as above, viewed from Employee side)*

---

#### **D. Many-to-Many (M:N)**

* Entities in **A** can relate to **multiple** in **B**, and vice versa.

**Example:**  
> **Students ↔ Courses**  
A student enrolls in many courses. A course has many students.

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210315135648/ManyToManyRelationship.jpg)

**Implementation:**  
Requires a **junction (bridge) table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    EnrollmentDate DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)
);
```

### **5. ER Diagram Notations**

| Cardinality | Crow's Foot Symbol | Line Style |
|-------------|--------------------|----------|
| **One**     | <code>&#9474;&#9474;</code> (double bar) | Mandatory (1) |
| **Zero or One** | <code>o&#9474;</code> | Optional (0..1) |
| **Many**    | <code>&#9500;&#9472;</code> (crow's foot) | One or more |

---

### **6. Table Merging Rules Based on Cardinality**

| Cardinality       | Can Merge Tables? | Conditions |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **1:1**           | Yes             | If **total participation** on at least one side |
| **1:N or N:1**    | Yes             | Merge the **"many" side** into the **"one" side** table |
| **M:N**           | No              | **Cannot merge** — needs a **separate junction table** |

#### **Example: Merging in 1:N**

```sql
-- Instead of separate tables, embed foreign key
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    DeptID INT,  -- Foreign key from Department
    DeptName VARCHAR(50)  -- Denormalized if merged
);
```

> Only do this if **performance > normalization**.

---

### **7. Summary Table**

| Cardinality     | Example                     | Merge Possible? | Junction Table? |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **1:1**         | Person ↔ Passport           | Yes (with total participation) | No |
| **1:N**         | Department → Employees      | Yes (add FK in Employees) | No |
| **N:1**         | Employees → Department      | Yes (same as above) | No |
| **M:N**         | Students ↔ Courses          | No               | Yes (Enrollment) |

---

### **8. Key Takeaways**

* **Cardinality defines relationship constraints** between entities.
* **1:1 and 1:N** allow **direct foreign key implementation**.
* **M:N requires a junction table** to resolve.
* Choose cardinality based on **real-world business rules**.
* Proper cardinality ensures **data integrity** and **efficient queries**.

---

**Pro Tip:**  
Always validate cardinality using **sample data** and **business scenarios** before finalizing the ER diagram.

# **CPU Scheduling Criteria – Operating System**

---

CPU scheduling is crucial to **maximize CPU efficiency** and ensure processes run smoothly. The **CPU scheduler** decides **which process runs next** and for how long, based on various criteria.

## **1. Key Criteria for CPU Scheduling**

### **1. CPU Utilization**

* **Goal:** Keep the CPU as busy as possible.
* **Meaning:** Percentage of time CPU is actively executing processes.
* **Ideal utilization:** **40% – 90%** (depends on system type).
* **Why important:**

  * Higher utilization → better use of hardware
  * Very high (≈100%) may cause poor response time

---

### **2. Throughput**

* **Definition:** Number of processes completed per unit time.
* **Unit:** Processes / second (or minute).
* **Interpretation:**

  * High throughput → more work done by the system
* **Depends on:**

  * Process execution time
  * System load
  * Scheduling algorithm

---

### **3. Turnaround Time**

* **Definition:** Total time taken by a process from submission to completion.
* **Includes:**

  * Waiting time
  * CPU execution time
  * I/O time

##### **Formula**

```
Turnaround Time = Completion Time − Arrival Time
```

---

### **4. Waiting Time**

* **Definition:** Total time a process spends waiting in the **ready queue**.
* **Does NOT include:** CPU execution time.

##### **Formula**

```
Waiting Time = Turnaround Time − Burst Time
```

---

### **5. Response Time**

* **Most important for:** Interactive systems (time-sharing, UI-based systems).
* **Definition:** Time from process arrival to the **first CPU response/output**.

##### **Formula**

```
Response Time = First CPU Allocation Time − Arrival Time
```

---

### **6. Completion Time**

* **Definition:** The exact time when a process finishes its execution.
* Used to calculate:

  * Turnaround Time
  * Waiting Time

---

### **7. Priority**

* **Meaning:** Each process is assigned a priority value.
* **Scheduling rule:**

  * Higher-priority process gets CPU first.
* **Used in:**

  * Priority Scheduling
  * Real-time systems

---

### **8. Predictability**

* **Definition:** Process should complete in roughly the **same amount of time** under similar system loads.
* **Why important:**

  * Real-time systems
  * Performance-sensitive applications

---

## **2. Importance of Choosing the Right Algorithm**

* Different algorithms prioritize **different criteria**.
* Wrong choice → suboptimal system performance.

**Examples:**

* **Round Robin** → Time-sharing systems (short response time needed)
* **Shortest Job First (SJF)** → Batch processing (maximize throughput)
* **Priority Scheduling** → Real-time systems (ensure urgent tasks complete first)

---

## **3. Factors Influencing CPU Scheduling**

1. Number of processes
2. Required processing time
3. Task urgency
4. System requirements

Choosing the **right algorithm** ensures efficient resource use, higher productivity, and better user satisfaction.

### **A. Non-Preemptive**

* **First Come First Served (FCFS)**
* **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
* **Longest Job First (LJF)**

### **B. Preemptive**

* **Priority Scheduling**
* **Round Robin (RR)**
* **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
* **Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)**
* **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**
* **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**

> CPU scheduling ensures **efficient system resource usage** and balances metrics like CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.

# TOPIC – LOOPS IN C++ (COMPLETE GUIDE)

Loop = Repeating a block of code until a condition is satisfied.

Without loops:
You would have to write the same line 1000 times.

With loops:
You write once, CPU repeats automatically.


## 1. WHY LOOPS ARE NEEDED

Example without loop:

```cpp
cout << 1;
cout << 2;
cout << 3;
cout << 4;
cout << 5;
```

With loop:

```cpp
for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
    cout << i;
```

Benefits:
• Saves time
• Reduces code
• Makes logic scalable
• Foundation of DSA


# TYPES OF LOOPS IN C++

1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop
4. range-based for loop (modern C++)


# 2. FOR LOOP (Most common in DSA)

### Syntax:

```cpp
for(initialization; condition; update) {
    // code
}
```

### Example:

```cpp
for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

Execution flow:

1. i = 1
2. check i <= 5
3. print
4. i++
5. repeat

Output:

```
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Dry Run:

i=1 → true → print
i=2 → true → print
i=3 → true → print
i=4 → true → print
i=5 → true → print
i=6 → false → stop

---

## Common for-loop patterns

### Reverse loop

```cpp
for(int i = 5; i >= 1; i--)
```

### Even numbers

```cpp
for(int i = 2; i <= 10; i += 2)
```


# 3. WHILE LOOP

Use when number of iterations is not fixed.

### Syntax:

```cpp
while(condition) {
    // code
}
```

### Example:

```cpp
int i = 1;
while(i <= 5) {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
```

Flow:
Check condition first → then execute.

---

### Difference: for vs while

| for loop         | while loop                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Known iterations | Unknown iterations        |
| Compact          | More flexible             |
| Used in arrays   | Used in input-based loops |


# 4. DO-WHILE LOOP

Runs at least once even if condition is false.

### Syntax:

```cpp
do {
   // code
} while(condition);
```

### Example:

```cpp
int i = 10;
do {
    cout << i;
    i++;
} while(i < 5);
```

Output:

```
10
```

Because body runs first, condition checked later.


# 5. RANGE-BASED FOR LOOP (Modern C++)

* This is called a range-based for loop in C++.

* It is used to iterate over all elements of a container (array, vector, string, set, etc.) one by one, without using index.

### Syntax:

```cpp
for (auto element : container)
{
    // use element
}
```

##### Meaning of Each Part

```
for (auto x : container)
```

***container***

* Any collection of elements
* Examples: vector, array, string, set, map

***x***

* Holds one element at a time from the container

***auto***

* Compiler automatically figures out the data type of x
* Saves you from writing long types

---

### How It Works (Step-by-Step)

Suppose:

```cpp
vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30};
```

Loop:

```cpp
for (auto x : v)
{
    cout << x << " ";
}
```

#### Execution Flow

```
1st iteration → x = 10
2nd iteration → x = 20
3rd iteration → x = 30
loop ends
```

---

### Example with String

```cpp
string s = "code";

for (auto ch : s)
{
    cout << ch << " ";
}
```

Output:

```
c o d e
```

Here:

* `auto` becomes `char`
* `ch` stores each character

---

### Important: Value vs Reference 
*This topic will covered later*

##### 1️⃣ By Value (copy) 

```cpp
for (auto x : v)
{
    x = x * 2;   // does NOT change vector
}
```

Vector remains unchanged.

---

##### 2️⃣ By Reference (important)

```cpp
for (auto& x : v)
{
    x = x * 2;   // modifies vector
}
```

Vector becomes:

```
20 40 60
```

---

### When to Use

Use `for(auto x : container)` when:

* You only need to **read elements**
* Index is **not required**
* Code clarity matters

---

### When NOT to Use

* When you need **index**
* When you need **parallel access to two containers**

---

### Interview One-Line

> Range-based for loop simplifies iteration by directly accessing elements without index handling.


# 6. NESTED LOOPS (Loop inside loop)

Used for patterns and matrices.

Example:

```cpp
for(int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for(int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        cout << "* ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

Output:

```
* * *
* * *
* * *
```

Time complexity = O(n²)


# 7. CONTROL STATEMENTS IN LOOPS

### break

Stops loop immediately.

```cpp
for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){
    if(i==5) break;
    cout << i;
}
```

Output:
1 2 3 4

### continue

Skips current iteration.

```cpp
for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){
    if(i==3) continue;
    cout << i;
}
```

Output:
1 2 4 5


# 8. COMMON LOOP ERRORS

1. Infinite Loop

```cpp
while(i > 0)   // i never changes ❌
```

2. Off-by-one error

```cpp
for(int i=0;i<=n;i++) // accessing arr[n] ❌
```

3. Forgetting update

```cpp
while(i<5) {
   cout << i;
}
```


# 9. DRY RUN EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```cpp
for(int i=0;i<3;i++)
   cout << i;
```

Output:
0 1 2

### Example 2

```cpp
int i=3;
while(i>0){
   cout << i;
   i--;
}
```

Output:
3 2 1


# 10. WHEN TO USE WHICH LOOP

| Situation        | Best Loop  |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Fixed iterations | for        |
| Condition based  | while      |
| Must run once    | do-while   |
| Containers       | range loop |


# MINI PRACTICE

1. Print numbers from 1 to 100
2. Print even numbers from 1 to 50
3. Reverse count from 10 to 1
4. Print multiplication table of 7
5. Pattern:

```
*
* *
* * *
```


# INTERVIEW QUICK POINTS

• Loop = repetition
• for = fixed range
• while = unknown count
• do-while = runs once minimum
• Nested loops increase time complexity
• break stops loop
• continue skips iteration

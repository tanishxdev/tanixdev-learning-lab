# Loops in C++ (Basics Practice)

This file is for **basic loop practice**.
Focus is on **thinking, control flow, and confidence**.

Do **NOT** look at solutions first.
Try each question on your own.

# Solutions (Check Only After Practice)

## Solution 1: Print 1 to 100

```cpp
for(int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
{
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

---

## Solution 2: Even Numbers from 1 to 50

```cpp
for(int i = 2; i <= 50; i += 2)
{
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

---

## Solution 3: Reverse Counting 10 to 1

```cpp
for(int i = 10; i >= 1; i--)
{
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

---

## Solution 4: Table of 7

```cpp
int num = 7;

for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
{
    cout << num << " x " << i << " = " << num * i << endl;
}
```

---

## Solution 5: Star Pattern

```cpp
for(int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
{
    for(int j = 1; j <= i; j++)
    {
        cout << "* ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

---

## Solution 6: Sum of First N Numbers

```cpp
int n;
cin >> n;

int sum = 0;

for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
{
    sum += i;
}

cout << sum;
```

---

## Solution 7: Count Digits

```cpp
int n;
cin >> n;

int count = 0;

while(n > 0)
{
    count++;
    n /= 10;
}

cout << count;
```

---

## Solution 8: Print Characters of String

```cpp
string s;
cin >> s;

for(char ch : s)
{
    cout << ch << endl;
}
```

## Final Notes (Very Important)

* Loops are **foundation of DSA**
* 90% beginner bugs come from:

  * wrong condition
  * missing update
  * off-by-one errors
* Always **dry run manually** once

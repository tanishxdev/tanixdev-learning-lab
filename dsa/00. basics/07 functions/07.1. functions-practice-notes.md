# Functions in C++ (Basics Practice)

This practice file is to **build clarity** on:

* functions
* parameters
* return values
* pass by value
* pass by reference

👉 **Rule**:
First read the problem, think, then check solution.

## Practice Questions

### Q1. Square of a Number

**Problem Statement**
Write a function that takes an integer and returns its **square**.

---

### Q2. Swap Two Numbers Using Pass by Reference

**Problem Statement**
Write a function to **swap two numbers** such that the change is visible in `main()`.

---

### Q3. Check Even or Odd

**Problem Statement**
Write a function that takes an integer and prints whether it is **even or odd**.

---

### Q4. Find Maximum of Two Numbers

**Problem Statement**
Write a function that takes two integers and returns the **maximum** of them.

---

### Q5. Demonstrate Pass by Value

**Problem Statement**
Write a function that tries to change a variable, but the change **should NOT reflect** in `main()`.

---

### Q6. Demonstrate Pass by Reference

**Problem Statement**
Write a function that changes a variable and the change **SHOULD reflect** in `main()`.

# Solutions (With Thought Process)

## Solution 1: Square of a Number

### Thought Process

* We need a function
* Input → one number
* Output → square of that number
* Square means `x * x`

### Code

```cpp
int square(int x)
{
    return x * x;   // multiply number with itself
}
```

Usage:

```cpp
int result = square(5);   // result = 25
```

---

## Solution 2: Swap Two Numbers (Pass by Reference)

### Thought Process

* Swapping requires changing original values
* Pass by value will fail
* So we must use **reference (&)**

### Code

```cpp
void swapNumbers(int &a, int &b)
{
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
```

Usage:

```cpp
int x = 10, y = 20;
swapNumbers(x, y);
// x = 20, y = 10
```

---

## Solution 3: Check Even or Odd

### Thought Process

* Even number → divisible by 2
* No need to return value
* Just print result

### Code

```cpp
void checkEvenOdd(int n)
{
    if (n % 2 == 0)
        cout << "Even";
    else
        cout << "Odd";
}
```

Usage:

```cpp
checkEvenOdd(7);   // Odd
```

---

## Solution 4: Maximum of Two Numbers

### Thought Process

* Compare two values
* Return the larger one
* Simple `if-else`

### Code

```cpp
int findMax(int a, int b)
{
    if (a > b)
        return a;
    else
        return b;
}
```

Usage:

```cpp
int m = findMax(10, 20);   // m = 20
```

---

## Solution 5: Pass by Value (No Change in Main)

### Thought Process

* Copy of variable is passed
* Change happens only inside function

### Code

```cpp
void changeValue(int x)
{
    x = 100;   // changes only local copy
}
```

Usage:

```cpp
int a = 10;
changeValue(a);
cout << a;   // Output: 10
```

### Why?

* `x` is a copy
* `a` remains unchanged

---

## Solution 6: Pass by Reference (Change Reflects)

### Thought Process

* Reference links to original variable
* Any change affects original

### Code

```cpp
void changeValue(int &x)
{
    x = 100;   // modifies original variable
}
```

Usage:

```cpp
int a = 10;
changeValue(a);
cout << a;   // Output: 100
```

## Key Patterns to Remember

| Situation                    | Use               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| No modification needed       | Pass by value     |
| Modification required        | Pass by reference |
| Large data (arrays, vectors) | Pass by reference |
| Safety more important        | Pass by value     |

## TOPIC 3 – IF ELSE STATEMENTS IN C++

This is what allows your program to **think and choose**.

---

## 1. Concept (What is if-else?)

`if-else` allows the program to execute code based on a condition.

Real life example:
If it is raining → take umbrella
Else → go without umbrella

Same logic in C++.

---

## 2. Why is if-else needed?

Without if-else:

* Program always runs in straight line.
* No decisions, no logic, no intelligence.

With if-else:

* Program reacts to different inputs.
* Dynamic behaviour becomes possible.

---

## 3. Basic Syntax

```cpp
if (condition) {
    // code runs when condition is true
}
else {
    // code runs when condition is false
}
```

Condition always gives:

* true or
* false

---

## 4. Simple Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age;
    cin >> age;

    if (age >= 18) {
        cout << "Eligible to vote";
    }
    else {
        cout << "Not eligible to vote";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Input:

```
16
```

Output:

```
Not eligible to vote
```

---

## 5. Flow Understanding

Suppose:
age = 20

Check:
age >= 18 → true
So IF block runs
ELSE is skipped completely.

---

## 6. if - else if - else (Multiple conditions)

Used when more than 2 conditions exist.

Syntax:

```cpp
if (condition1) {
}
else if (condition2) {
}
else {
}
```

Example: Marks grading

```cpp
int marks;
cin >> marks;

if (marks >= 90)
    cout << "Grade A";
else if (marks >= 75)
    cout << "Grade B";
else if (marks >= 50)
    cout << "Grade C";
else
    cout << "Fail";
```

---

## 7. Comparison Operators

Used inside conditions:

| Operator | Meaning          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| >        | greater          |
| <        | smaller          |
| >=       | greater or equal |
| <=       | smaller or equal |
| ==       | equal            |
| !=       | not equal        |

Example:

```
if (x == 10)
if (y != 0)
```

---

## 8. Logical Operators

Used to **combine multiple conditions** in an `if` statement.

| Operator | Name | Meaning                              | Example          |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------- 
| `&&`     | AND  | True if **both conditions** are true | `a > 0 && b > 0` |
| `        |      | `                                    | OR               |
| `!`      | NOT  | Reverses the condition               | `!isAdult`       |

### Examples

```cpp
// AND: both conditions must be true
if (age >= 18 && age <= 60)
```

```cpp
// OR: any one condition can be true
if (day == "Sunday" || day == "Saturday")
```

```cpp
// NOT: reverses the condition
if (!isLoggedIn)
```

---

#### Key Interview Note

* `&&` stops early if the first condition is false
* `||` stops early if the first condition is true
* This is called **short-circuit evaluation**

---

## 9. Nested if-else

if inside another if.

```cpp
if (age >= 18) {
    if (age < 60)
        cout << "Working age";
    else
        cout << "Senior citizen";
}
else {
    cout << "Minor";
}
```

---

## 10. Common Mistakes

1. Using = instead of ==

    ```
    if (x = 5)   // WRONG
    if (x == 5)  // CORRECT
    ```

2. Missing braces causing logic issues

3. Too many nested ifs → hard to read

---

## Real Dry Run Example

Code:

```cpp
int x = 5;

if (x > 10)
    cout << "A";
else if (x > 3)
    cout << "B";
else
    cout << "C";
```

Dry run:
x = 5
5 > 10 ❌
5 > 3 ✅
Output = B

---

## Mini Practice

### 1. Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero

```cpp
int num;
cin >> num;

if (num > 0)
    cout << "Positive";
else if (num < 0)
    cout << "Negative";
else
    cout << "Zero";
```

---

### 2. Check Driving Eligibility (Age ≥ 18)

```cpp
int age;
cin >> age;

if (age >= 18)
    cout << "Eligible for driving";
else
    cout << "Not eligible for driving";
```

---

### 3. Input Marks and Print Grade

```cpp
int marks;
cin >> marks;

if (marks >= 90)
    cout << "Grade A";
else if (marks >= 75)
    cout << "Grade B";
else if (marks >= 60)
    cout << "Grade C";
else
    cout << "Fail";
```

## Interview Quick Points

• if checks a condition
• else runs when condition fails
• else if allows multiple conditions
• Conditions return boolean
• == is for comparison

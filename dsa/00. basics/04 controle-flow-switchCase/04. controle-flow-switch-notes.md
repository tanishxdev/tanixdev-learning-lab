## TOPIC 4 – SWITCH STATEMENT IN C++

Switch is another way of decision making, but more structured than multiple if-else.

---

## 1. Concept (What is switch?)

`switch` is used when:

* You want to check ONE variable
* Against MULTIPLE fixed values

It replaces long chains of:

```
if (x == 1)
else if (x == 2)
else if (x == 3) ...
```

---

## 2. Why switch is needed?

Problems with multiple if-else:
• Hard to read
• Messy code
• Less structured

Switch provides:
• Cleaner code
• Better readability
• Faster understanding

---

## 3. Basic Syntax

```cpp
switch(expression) {
    case value1:
        // code
        break;

    case value2:
        // code
        break;

    default:
        // code
}
```

Important:

* Expression is usually int or char
* break stops execution of further cases

---

## 4. Basic Example

```cpp
int day = 3;

switch(day) {
    case 1:
        cout << "Monday";
        break;

    case 2:
        cout << "Tuesday";
        break;

    case 3:
        cout << "Wednesday";
        break;

    default:
        cout << "Invalid day";
}
```

Output:

```
Wednesday
```

---

## 5. Flow Dry Run

day = 3

Check:
case 1 → no
case 2 → no
case 3 → yes → prints "Wednesday"
break → exit switch

---

## 6. Importance of `break` (Switch Case)

### Code (without `break`)

```cpp
int x = 2;

switch (x) {
    case 1:
        cout << "One";
    case 2:
        cout << "Two";
    case 3:
        cout << "Three";
}
```

---

### Execution Flow (Step by Step)

1. `x = 2`
2. `switch(x)` checks cases **top to bottom**
3. `case 1:` ❌ not matched → skip
4. `case 2:` ✅ matched → execution **starts here**

   ```
   cout << "Two";
   ```
5. **NO break present**, so execution **does NOT stop**
6. It automatically goes to the **next case**

   ```
   cout << "Three";
   ```
7. Switch block ends

---

### Final Output

```
TwoThree
```

---

### Why this happens (Key Rule)

> In `switch`, once a case matches, **execution continues until a `break` is found or switch ends**.

This is called **fall-through behavior**.

---

### Correct Code (with `break`)

```cpp
int x = 2;

switch (x) {
    case 1:
        cout << "One";
        break;
    case 2:
        cout << "Two";
        break;
    case 3:
        cout << "Three";
        break;
}
```

### Output

```
Two
```

---

### Visual Flow (Simple)

Without `break`:

```
case 2 → execute → fall to case 3 → execute → end
```

With `break`:

```
case 2 → execute → break → exit switch
```

---

### Interview One-Line Answer

> `break` is used to stop execution after a matched case; without it, switch cases fall through to the next cases.

---

## 7. default case

Runs when no case matches.

```cpp
switch(choice) {
    case 1: cout << "Add"; break;
    case 2: cout << "Subtract"; break;
    default: cout << "Invalid choice";
}
```

---

## 8. Switch vs If-Else

| switch                | if-else                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Best for fixed values | Best for ranges             |
| Cleaner for menus     | Good for complex conditions |
| Faster readability    | More flexible               |

Use switch when:

* Checking single variable
* Against exact values

---

## 9. Practical Example (Menu system)

```cpp
int choice;
cin >> choice;

switch(choice) {
    case 1:
        cout << "Play Game";
        break;
    case 2:
        cout << "Settings";
        break;
    case 3:
        cout << "Exit";
        break;
    default:
        cout << "Invalid Option";
}
```

---

## 10. Common Mistakes

1. Forgetting break
2. Using float/double in switch (not allowed)
3. Expecting range logic inside switch

This is wrong:

```
case x > 5:  ❌
```

## Mini Practice

1. Print Day of Week (1–7)
2. Simple Calculator Using `switch`
3. Traffic Light System
---

### Key Learning

* `switch` is best when **fixed options** are known
* `break` prevents **fall-through**
* `default` handles **invalid input**
---

## Interview Quick Points

• switch checks fixed constant values
• break stops case execution
• default handles unmatched values
• Better for menu-driven programs

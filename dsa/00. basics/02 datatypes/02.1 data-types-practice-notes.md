# Data Types in C++ – Practice (Basics)

This practice file helps you understand:

* how data types work
* memory & behavior
* common mistakes
* basic type conversion

👉 **Rule**:
Solve first on your own, then check solutions.

---

## PRACTICE QUESTIONS

### Q1. Declare Basic Variables

**Problem Statement**
Declare variables to store:

* your age
* your height (decimal)
* your first letter

Then print them.

---

### Q2. Integer vs Decimal

**Problem Statement**
Store a decimal number in an `int` variable and print it.
Observe the output.

---

### Q3. Character Storage

**Problem Statement**
Store a character in a `char` variable and print it.

---

### Q4. Boolean Variable

**Problem Statement**
Declare a boolean variable, assign `true`, and print it.

---

### Q5. Size of Data Types

**Problem Statement**
Print the size (in bytes) of:

* int
* float
* double
* char
* bool

---

### Q6. Unsigned Integer

**Problem Statement**
Declare an `unsigned int` and store a positive value.
Try storing a negative value and observe behavior.

---

### Q7. ASCII Value Behavior

**Problem Statement**
Assign an integer value `65` to a `char` variable and print it.

---

### Q8. Implicit Type Conversion

**Problem Statement**
Add an `int` and a `double` and print the result.

---

### Q9. Explicit Type Conversion

**Problem Statement**
Convert a `double` value to `int` using type casting.

---

### Q10. Predict the Output

**Problem Statement**
Predict the output before running:

```cpp
int a = 10;
double b = 3.7;
cout << a + b;
```

# SOLUTIONS (WITH THINKING PROCESS)

## Q1 Solution: Declare Basic Variables

### Thinking

* Age → whole number → `int`
* Height → decimal → `float` or `double`
* First letter → single character → `char`

### Code

```cpp
int age = 20;
float height = 5.6;
char firstLetter = 'A';

cout << age << endl;
cout << height << endl;
cout << firstLetter << endl;
```

---

## Q2 Solution: Integer vs Decimal

### Thinking

* `int` cannot store decimals
* Decimal part is discarded

### Code

```cpp
int x = 3.9;
cout << x;
```

### Output

```
3
```

---

## Q3 Solution: Character Storage

### Thinking

* `char` stores exactly one character
* Must use single quotes

### Code

```cpp
char grade = 'A';
cout << grade;
```

---

## Q4 Solution: Boolean Variable

### Thinking

* `bool` stores `true` or `false`
* Printed as `1` or `0`

### Code

```cpp
bool isPassed = true;
cout << isPassed;
```

### Output

```
1
```

---

## Q5 Solution: Size of Data Types

### Thinking

* `sizeof()` gives memory in bytes

### Code

```cpp
cout << sizeof(int) << endl;
cout << sizeof(float) << endl;
cout << sizeof(double) << endl;
cout << sizeof(char) << endl;
cout << sizeof(bool) << endl;
```

---

## Q6 Solution: Unsigned Integer

### Thinking

* Unsigned allows only positive values
* Negative values cause unexpected results

### Code

```cpp
unsigned int x = 10;
cout << x;

// unsigned int y = -5; // wrong usage
```

---

## Q7 Solution: ASCII Value Behavior

### Thinking

* `char` internally stores ASCII values
* 65 corresponds to 'A'

### Code

```cpp
char ch = 65;
cout << ch;
```

### Output

```
A
```

---

## Q8 Solution: Implicit Type Conversion

### Thinking

* `int` is automatically converted to `double`
* Result is `double`

### Code

```cpp
int a = 5;
double b = 2.5;
cout << a + b;
```

### Output

```
7.5
```

---

## Q9 Solution: Explicit Type Conversion

### Thinking

* Manual type casting forces conversion
* Decimal part is lost

### Code

```cpp
double x = 9.8;
int y = (int)x;

cout << y;
```

### Output

```
9
```

---

## Q10 Solution: Predict the Output

### Code

```cpp
int a = 10;
double b = 3.7;
cout << a + b;
```

### Thinking

* `a` becomes `10.0`
* `10.0 + 3.7 = 13.7`

### Output

```
13.7
```

---

## FINAL REMEMBER POINTS (INTERVIEW)

* Data type decides **memory + operations**
* `int` → whole numbers
* `float/double` → decimals
* `char` → single character (ASCII based)
* `bool` → true / false
* Casting can cause **data loss**

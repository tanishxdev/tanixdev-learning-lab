## TOPIC 1 – USER INPUT / OUTPUT IN C++

---

### 1. Concept (What is Input / Output?)

In programming:

* **Input** = Taking data from the user (keyboard, file, etc.)
* **Output** = Showing data to the user (screen, console, file, etc.)

In C++, the console screen is the most common way.

We use:

* `cin` → for input
* `cout` → for output

Both come from the **iostream** library.

---

### 2. Why is this needed?

Without input/output:

* Program cannot interact with user.
* Values must be hardcoded.
* Program becomes useless for real-world cases.

Example:
Instead of:

```
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
```

We want:
User enters numbers, program processes them.

### 3. Basic Output in C++

Syntax:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World";
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

* `cout` means "console output"
* `<<` is insertion operator (puts data into screen)

More examples:

```cpp
cout << "Welcome to C++";
cout << 10;
cout << 5 + 3;
```

Output:

```
Welcome to C++
10
8
```

---

### 4. Basic Input in C++

Syntax:

```cpp
int x;
cin >> x;
```

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int number;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> number;

    cout << "You entered: " << number;
    return 0;
}
```

Flow:
User types → 25
Program stores → number = 25
Output → You entered: 25

---

### 5. Multiple Inputs

```cpp
int a, b;
cin >> a >> b;
```

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;

    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> a >> b;

    cout << "Sum = " << a + b;
    return 0;
}
```

Input:

```
5 7
```

Output:

```
Sum = 12
```

---

### 6. Input / Output with Strings

Important: There are two ways.

#### Method 1: cin (word only)

```cpp
string name;
cin >> name;
```

Stops at space.

Input:

```
John Doe
```

Stored:

```
John
```

#### Method 2: getline (full line)

```cpp
string name;
getline(cin, name);
```

Example:

```cpp
string name;
cout << "Enter full name: ";
getline(cin, name);
cout << name;
```

---

### 7. Common Mistakes

1. Forgot include iostream
2. Using cin for full sentences
3. Not using `getline` after cin (buffer issue)
4. Writing:

```
cin << x;   // WRONG
cout >> x;  // WRONG
```

Correct:

```
cin >> x;
cout << x;
```

---

### 8. Complete Working Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age;
    string name;

    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    getline(cin, name);

    cout << "Enter your age: ";
    cin >> age;

    cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << age;

    return 0;
}
```

## Mini Practice (Try yourself)

1. Take two integers and print their product
2. Take user's name and favourite number and display both
3. Input 3 numbers and print their average

---

### Interview Quick Points

* cin uses extraction operator `>>`
* cout uses insertion operator `<<`
* getline used for full-line string input

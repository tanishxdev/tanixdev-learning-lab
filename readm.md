# Learning Repository

#### ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is a **learning playground**.

- Code may be **incomplete, buggy, or experimental**
- Some solutions may be **incorrect or sub-optimal**
- Some projects or plans may be **partially implemented**
- Focus is on **learning and documentation**, not perfection

For **production-grade work**, please refer to my **separate project repositories**.

---

##### 🎯 Purpose

This is my personal space to:

- Document what I learn
- Break down concepts
- Practice problems and interview questions
- Experiment and build mini-projects
- Plan learning using `.md` files (instead of a separate journal)

---

##### 📂 What You’ll Find

Depending on the topic, this repo may contain:

- Concept notes and explanations
- Large problem sets (sometimes 50s per topic/domain/subject)
- Interview questions and edge cases
- Practice code and experiments
- Mini-projects or planned project lists

---

##### 🧠 About Large Question Counts

A high number of questions is **intentional**.

- One concept is broken into multiple smaller questions
- Many questions may come from the same topic
- This helps with **topic-wise learning** and avoids overwhelm

**Tip:** Focus on topics, not the question count.

---

##### 🤖 AI Assistance (Transparency)

Some content (notes, comments, code, or docs) may be **AI-assisted** to avoid repetitive work.

- This may result in over-explanation or inconsistency
- This is not hidden intentionally

Learning, verification, and understanding remain **my responsibility**.

---

##### 🛠 Code Quality Note

Since this is a learning repo:

- Code may have bugs or incomplete implementations
- Some projects may be half-built or planned

Content is improved **iteratively over time**.

---

##### 📌 Note

This repository represents **learning in progress**, not final expertise.

---

##### ✅ How to Navigate

- Go **topic-wise**, not file-wise
- Read `.md` files for context
- Treat this as a **learning log and growth record**

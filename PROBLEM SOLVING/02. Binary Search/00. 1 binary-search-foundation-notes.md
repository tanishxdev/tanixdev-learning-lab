# 🧠 FOUNDATION OF BINARY SEARCH

“Binary Search is not about arrays; it’s about *monotonicity* (ordered behavior).”

---

# PART 1: WHAT, WHY, HOW, WHEN

## 🔴 WHAT is Binary Search?

A searching technique that repeatedly divides the search space into two halves.

Works on three types of monotonic spaces:

1. **Values increase then decrease** (like a mountain array)
2. **Property shifts from False → True** (typical BS-on-answer)
3. **Sorted structure** (1D, 2D, rotated, etc.)

---

## 🔵 WHY use Binary Search?

Because it reduces time complexity from:

* **O(n)** (linear) to
* **O(log n)** (binary) — extremely fast for large data.

---

## 🟢 WHEN can Binary Search be used?

Whenever the answer lies in a range or sequence where you can say:

**If condition is true at position x, then it is also true at all positions to its right (or left).**
This is monotonic behavior.

Examples:

* arr[mid] < target ⇒ target must be on the right
* can we ship packages in X days ⇒ if yes at X, then yes for all Y > X

---

## 🔵 HOW to use Binary Search?

General pattern:

```
low = start
high = end

while(low <= high):
    mid = low + (high - low)/2

    if(condition(mid)):
        move_left_or_right()
    else:
        move_other_side()
```

# PART 2: THE 3 PATTERNS OF BINARY SEARCH

# PATTERN 1 — BS ON 1D SORTED ARRAYS

(Your foundation: Lower bound, upper bound, insert pos, floor/ceil, first/last occurrence)

## Core Rule:

Sorted array means **if something is not in left half, it must be in right half**.

### Core Problems:

1. Search X in sorted array
2. Lower bound (first >= x)
3. Upper bound (first > x)
4. Search Insert Position
5. Floor/Ceil
6. First & Last Occurrence
7. Count occurrences
8. Single element (pairs + 1)
9. Peak element
10. **Rotated sorted arrays (foundation)** ← explained in detail below

---


# PATTERN 2 — BS ON 2D ARRAYS

Used when:

* Entire matrix is sorted (like flattened 1D)
* Each row sorted + next row starts after previous ends
* Row + column sorted
* 2D peak finding

2D BS requires:

* Mapping 2D → 1D
  or
* Shrinking dimension by dimension

---


# PATTERN 3 — BS ON SEARCH SPACE (BS ON ANSWERS)

This is **the most powerful form**.

Used when there is NO array, but **an answer range**.
Example: "Can we complete task in X hours?"
Space = X in [low, high].

Key idea:

* If X is possible, maybe bigger X is also possible → monotonic property.

Used in:

* Minimum pages allocation
* Split Array Largest Sum
* Koko eating bananas
* Minimum days to make bouquets
* Aggressive cows
* Gas stations
* Median of 2 arrays
* Divisor problem
* Nth root
* Square root

# PART 3 — ROTATED SORTED ARRAYS 

This is the **core confusion** for most beginners.

We will clear:

### 1) What is rotation?

### 2) Why rotation breaks normal binary search?

### 3) How rotated array is structured?

### 4) How to detect which half is sorted?

### 5) How to find pivot?

### 6) How to find number of rotations?

### 7) How to find minimum element?

### 8) How to search in rotated array?

### 9) How to search when duplicates exist?

Everything below.

# 🧠 ROTATION THEORY — FULL FOUNDATIONAL EXPLANATION

## 🔴 What is a rotated sorted array?

Originally sorted array:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

Rotated at some pivot:

```
[4,5,6,1,2,3]
↑ Pivot (break point)
```

The array is still partially sorted:
Left side: increasing
Right side: increasing
Only the order between the two parts is broken.

---

## 🔵 Why does rotation break normal binary search?

Because arr[mid] < target does NOT guarantee target is on the right.

Example:

```
[4,5,6,1,2,3], target = 2
mid may be 5 (6)
```

You can’t decide left or right using normal BS logic, because the sorted property is broken at the pivot.

---

## 🟢 How to fix this?

Use this golden rule:

### **In rotated sorted array, at least ONE HALF is always sorted.**

At any mid:

* Check if left half is sorted
* Else right half is sorted

This gives direction.

---


# 🔴 Detecting Sorted Half (MOST IMPORTANT)

At mid index:

```
if(arr[low] <= arr[mid]):
    left half sorted
else:
    right half sorted
```

Then check if target lies inside the sorted half.
If yes → normal BS inside sorted half.
If no → go to the other half.


---

# 🔵 Finding the PIVOT (smallest element)

Pivot = index of minimum element
Also = number of rotations (if no duplicates)

Binary Search logic:

```
while(low < high):
    mid = low + (high-low)/2

    if(arr[mid] > arr[high]):
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid
return low
```

This works because min element is the only element smaller than its left.

---


# 🟢 Number of Rotations

In strictly increasing rotated array:

```
rotations = pivotIndex
```

Example:

```
[4,5,6,1,2,3] → pivot = 3 → rotated 3 times
```

---


# 🔴 Searching in Rotated Sorted Array (No duplicates)

Steps:

1. Find which half is sorted
2. Check if target lies in that half
3. Apply normal BS inside that half

Time: **O(log n)**
Space: **O(1)**

---

# 🔵 Searching in Rotated Sorted Array (With duplicates)

Duplicates break `sorted half detection`, because:

```
arr[low] == arr[mid] == arr[high]
```

You can’t decide sorted half reliably.
Fix:

```
low++
high--
```

Worst-case: O(n) but acceptable.

---

# 🟢 Minimum element in rotated sorted array

Same as finding pivot:

* If mid element > arr[high] → min is right side
* Else → min is left or at mid

---

# FULL INTUITIVE SUMMARY — ROTATION SERIES

### Concept

A rotated array is two sorted arrays joined together.

### Structure

```
[L sorted] + [R sorted]
```

### Key Observation

At any mid:

```
one half is always sorted.
```

### Search Strategy

* Identify sorted half
* Check if target lies inside
* Move inside that half
* Else move to other half

### Pivot & Min

Smallest element is the pivot point.

### Duplicates

Shrink boundaries when equality blocks sorted detection.

---

# FINAL SHORT FORM YOU WILL USE IN FUTURE

### Detect sorted half:

```
if(arr[low] <= arr[mid]): left sorted
else: right sorted
```

### Pivot:

```
if(arr[mid] > arr[high]): low = mid+1
else: high = mid
```

### Rotations:

```
pivotIndex
```

### Search in rotated array:

* Identify sorted half
* Binary search in sorted part
* Move accordingly

### 1. What is JavaScript? (Introduction to JS)
- JavaScript is a language that makes websites **alive** and **interactive**.  
- Example: When you click a button and a popup comes → that’s JavaScript!  
- It runs in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).  
- You can also run it on a computer using Node.js.  
- It is **lightweight** (small size) and **fast**.  
- It works with HTML and CSS to make beautiful websites.  

**Super easy first program** (Hello World):  
Open any browser, press F12 → go to Console tab → type this and press Enter:  
```js
console.log("Hello, I am learning JS!");
```
You will see the message! That’s your first JS code.

### 2. JS Syntax (How to write JS code)
Syntax = rules of writing code (like grammar in English).  

**Simple rules**:  
- Every line ends with ; (like full stop)  
- Use { } for blocks of code  
- Variable names start with letter, $ or _  

**Example** (very simple):  
```js
let name = "Rohan";     // create a box called name
console.log(name);      // print it → Rohan
```

### 3. How to Add JS in HTML Document
There are 3 easy ways:

**Way 1: Inside HTML (Internal)**  
```html
<html>
<body>
  <button onclick="alert('Hi!')">Click me</button>

  <script>
    console.log("I am inside the page!");
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Way 2: External file (Best for big projects)**  
1. Make a file → name it script.js  
2. Write code inside it:  
```js
alert("I came from another file!");
```
3. Link it in HTML:  
```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

**Way 3: Inline (small code)**  
```html
<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Press</button>
```

### 4. JS Versions (Simple history)
JavaScript keeps getting new features every year.  
Here are the important ones (easy table):

| Year | Name       | Cool new things you get                  |
|------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| 2009 | ES5        | JSON, strict mode                        |
| 2015 | ES6        | let, const, arrow =>, classes            |
| 2016 | ES7        | async/await                              |
| 2020 | ES11       | BigInt (very big numbers)                |
| 2023 | ES14       | new array methods like findLast()        |

Don’t worry about old versions. Just use modern JS (ES6+). All new browsers support it!

### 5. JS Comments (Notes in code)
Comments = words that computer ignores. You write them to explain your code.  

**Two types**:  
```js
// This is one line comment (use this most)

 /* This is many lines comment
    You can write long notes here */
```

Example:  
```js
// This prints my name
console.log("Priya");
```

### 6. JS Statements (Instructions)
Statement = one line that tells computer to do something.  

**Examples**:  
```js
let age = 15;           // create a box and put 15
age = age + 1;          // add 1 (now age = 16)
console.log(age);       // print it
if (age > 10) {         // check condition
  console.log("You are big!");
}
```

Common statements you will use:  
- let, const (make variables)  
- if, else (make decisions)  
- function (make reusable code)  
- return (give answer back)  

### 7. JS Events (When user does something)
Event = action like click, type, move mouse, etc.  

**Common events**:  
- onclick → when you click  
- onmouseover → when mouse comes on something  
- onkeydown → when you press a key  

**Super easy example** (copy and try):  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <h1>Click the button!</h1>
  <button onclick="sayHello()">Click Me</button>

  <script>
    function sayHello() {
      alert("Hello! You clicked the button!");
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```
Save as test.html → double click → try it!

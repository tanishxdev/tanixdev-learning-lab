## TOPIC 2 – DATA TYPES IN C++

This topic decides:
• What kind of data you store
• How much memory it takes
• What operations are allowed

Without data types, C++ cannot understand what you want to do.

---

## 1. What is a Data Type?

A data type tells the compiler:

* What type of value a variable will hold.
* How much memory to reserve.
* How to interpret that value.

Example:

```
int age = 20;
```

Here:

* int = data type
* age = variable
* 20 = value

Means:
age can only store whole numbers.

---

## 2. Why Data Types are Needed?

Because different data behave differently.

Number vs Text vs Decimal vs True/False

You cannot treat:

* "Hello" like a number
* 3.14 like a boolean

Data type ensures:
• Safety
• Correct memory usage
• Correct operations

## 3. Types of Data Types in C++

### A) Primitive (Basic) Data Types

1. int
   Stores whole numbers
   Example:

```
int a = 10;
int b = -5;
```

2. float
   Stores decimal numbers (less precision)

```
float pi = 3.14;
```

3. double
   Stores decimal numbers (more precision)

```
double value = 3.14159265;
```

4. char
   Stores single character

```
char grade = 'A';
char symbol = '#';
```

5. bool
   Stores true or false

```
bool isLoggedIn = true;
```

---

## 4. Memory Size & Range (Important)

| Data Type | Size    | Example      |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ |
| int       | 4 bytes | 10           |
| float     | 4 bytes | 3.14         |
| double    | 8 bytes | 3.1415926535 |
| char      | 1 byte  | 'A'          |
| bool      | 1 byte  | true / false |

---

## 5. Declaring Variables

Syntax:

```
datatype variableName;
```

Examples:

```
int marks;
float temperature;
char ch;
bool status;
```

With value:

```
int marks = 90;
float temp = 36.5;
char grade = 'B';
bool passed = true;
```

---

## 6. Type Modifiers

Used to change size range.

1. short int
2. long int
3. unsigned int

Example:

```
unsigned int count = 100;
long long int distance = 1000000000;
```

Unsigned means:
Only positive values allowed.

---

## 7. Real Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age = 20;
    float height = 5.6;
    char gender = 'M';
    bool isStudent = true;

    cout << age << endl;
    cout << height << endl;
    cout << gender << endl;
    cout << isStudent << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
20
5.6
M
1
```

Note:
true prints as 1, false as 0.

---

## 8. Common Mistakes

1. Using single quotes for string:
   'Hello' ❌
   "Hello" ✅

2. Storing decimal in int:

```
int x = 3.5;  // becomes 3 (data loss)
```

3. Wrong type assumption:

```
char ch = 65; // prints A (ASCII)
```

---

## 9. Type Conversion (Basic idea)

Implicit:

```
int a = 5;
double b = a;  // auto conversion
```

Explicit:

```
double x = 9.7;
int y = (int)x;  // forced conversion
```

---

## Mini Practice

1. Declare variables for:

   * Your age
   * Your height
   * Your first letter

2. Print them.

3. Try:

```
int a = 10;
double b = 3.7;
cout << a + b;
```

Predict output.

## Interview Quick Points

• int → whole numbers
• float/double → decimal values
• char → single character
• bool → true/false
• Data type decides memory + operations

# User Input / Output in C++ – Practice (Basics)

This practice file helps you understand:

* how `cin` and `cout` work
* taking multiple inputs
* string input using `cin` vs `getline`
* common beginner mistakes

👉 **Rule**:
Try solving on your own first.
Then check the solutions.

# SOLUTIONS (WITH THINKING PROCESS)

## Q1 Solution: Print Message

### Thinking

* Only output is required
* Use `cout`

### Code

```cpp
cout << "Welcome to C++";
```

---

## Q2 Solution: Input and Print Number

### Thinking

* Use `cin` to take input
* Use `cout` to display it

### Code

```cpp
int x;
cin >> x;
cout << x;
```

---

## Q3 Solution: Product of Two Numbers

### Thinking

* Take two inputs
* Multiply them
* Print result

### Code

```cpp
int a, b;
cin >> a >> b;

cout << a * b;
```

---

## Q4 Solution: Sum of Three Numbers

### Thinking

* Three integers
* Add them together

### Code

```cpp
int a, b, c;
cin >> a >> b >> c;

cout << a + b + c;
```

---

## Q5 Solution: Average of Three Numbers

### Thinking

* Average = sum / count
* Use `double` for correct decimal result

### Code

```cpp
int a, b, c;
cin >> a >> b >> c;

double avg = (a + b + c) / 3.0;
cout << avg;
```

---

## Q6 Solution: Name Using `cin`

### Thinking

* `cin` reads only one word
* Stops at space

### Code

```cpp
string name;
cin >> name;

cout << name;
```

---

## Q7 Solution: Full Name Using `getline`

### Thinking

* Full name may contain spaces
* `getline` is required

### Code

```cpp
string name;
getline(cin, name);

cout << name;
```

---

## Q8 Solution: Name and Favourite Number

### Thinking

* Mix of string and integer input
* Use `getline` first, then `cin`

### Code

```cpp
string name;
int fav;

getline(cin, name);
cin >> fav;

cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
cout << "Favourite Number: " << fav;
```

---

## Q9 Solution: Multiple Inputs in One Line

### Thinking

* `cin` can read multiple values using `>>`

### Code

```cpp
int a, b;
cin >> a >> b;

cout << a + b;
```

---

## Q10 Solution: Predict the Output

### Code

```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = 2;
cout << a + b;
```

### Thinking

* Simple integer addition
* 5 + 2 = 7

### Output

```
7
```

## FINAL REMEMBER POINTS (INTERVIEW)

* `cin` → input from keyboard
* `cout` → output to screen
* `>>` → extraction operator
* `<<` → insertion operator
* `cin` stops at space
* `getline` reads full line
* Order of `cin` and `getline` matters

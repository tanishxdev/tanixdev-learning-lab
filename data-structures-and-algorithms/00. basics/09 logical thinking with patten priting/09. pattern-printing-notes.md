# PATTERNS PRINTING

Patterns are not just printing stars.
They train you to:

* Control loops
* Understand row-column relationships
* Build algorithmic thinking

Rule:
👉 Every pattern depends on:
Row number (i)
Column number (j)

---

## HOW TO THINK FOR ANY PATTERN

Always ask:

1. How many rows?
2. What to print in each row?
3. How many columns per row?
4. How does it change each line?

General skeleton:

```cpp
for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {        // rows
    for(int j=1; j<=something; j++) {   // columns
        print;
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

========================================================

# PATTERN 1 – Solid Square

For n = 4

```
****
****
****
****
```

Logic:
Rows = n
Columns = n

Code idea:

```
for i = 1 to n
   for j = 1 to n
      print *
```

---

# PATTERN 2 – Right Triangle

n = 5

```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

Logic:
Row number = number of stars
i stars in row i

---

# PATTERN 3 – Inverted Right Triangle

n = 5

```
*****
****
***
**
*
```

Logic:
Stars = n - i + 1

---

# PATTERN 4 – Number Triangle

n = 5

```
1
12
123
1234
12345
```

Logic:
Print numbers from 1 to i

---

# PATTERN 5 – Repeated Number Triangle

n = 5

```
1
22
333
4444
55555
```

Logic:
Print i, i times

---

# PATTERN 6 – Pyramid Star Pattern

n = 4

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
```

Logic per row:
Spaces = n - i
Stars = 2*i - 1

---

# PATTERN 7 – Inverted Pyramid

n = 4

```
*******
 *****
  ***
   *
```

Logic:
Spaces = i - 1
Stars = 2*(n - i) + 1

---

# PATTERN 8 – Diamond

n = 4

```
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
 *****
  ***
   *
```

Logic:
Pyramid + Inverted Pyramid

---

# PATTERN 9 – Binary Pattern

n = 5

```
1
01
101
0101
10101
```

Logic:
(i + j) % 2

---

# PATTERN 10 – Hollow Square

n = 5

```
*****
*   *
*   *
*   *
*****
```

Logic:
Print * when:

* i == 1
* i == n
* j == 1
* j == n
  else print space

========================================================

# HOW TO MASTER PATTERNS (Rule)

Every star pattern boils down to:

1. Spaces logic
2. Character logic
3. Relationship with row index

---

# MASTER TEMPLATE CODE

```cpp
int n = 5;

for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
    for(int j = 1; j <= n; j++){
        cout << "*";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

You modify inner loop logic based on pattern need.

# INTERVIEW EXPECTATION

Most common pattern questions:

* Star Pyramid
* Diamond
* Hollow Square
* Number Triangle
* Pascal's Triangle (later)

# MINI PRACTICE FOR YOU

Try to predict outputs for n = 4:

1.

```
for i = 1 to n
  for j = 1 to i
    print "*"
```

2.

```
for i = n to 1
  for j = 1 to i
    print j
```

3.

```
for i = 1 to n
  print spaces(n-i) and stars(2*i-1)
```

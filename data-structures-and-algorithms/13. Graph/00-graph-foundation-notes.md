# GRAPH FOUNDATION

## 0. Why Graphs Are Difficult for Beginners

Because graphs:

1. Are **not linear** like arrays.
2. Have **multiple ways** of representation.
3. Use **recursion + loops together**.
4. Combine many ideas: BFS, DFS, shortest path, cycle detection, topo sort, DSU.

So we build step-by-step.

# PART 1 — CORE GRAPH THEORY (ABSOLUTE FOUNDATION)

## 1. What is a Graph?

A **graph** is a collection of:

* **Nodes** (also called vertices)
* **Edges** (connections between nodes)

### Graph = V nodes + E edges

Example:

```
1 --- 2
|     |
4 --- 3
```

#### Why Do We Need Graphs? (Very Important)

Arrays, linked lists, trees are linear or hierarchical.
But real-world problems are not linear.

**Real-world examples**

| Problem              | Why Graph                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Google Maps          | Cities = nodes, roads = edges      |
| Social Network       | Users = nodes, friendships = edges |
| Internet             | Routers = nodes, cables = edges    |
| Course prerequisites | Courses = nodes, dependency = edge |
| Maze / Grid          | Cell = node, path = edge           |


---

## 2. Graph Types (Must Know 100%)

### a) Based on Edges

1. **Undirected Graph**
   Edges have no direction.

```
1 --- 2  means 1 connected to 2 both ways
```

2. **Directed Graph (DiGraph)**
   Edges have direction.

```
1 → 2  means you can only go from 1 to 2
```

---

### b) Based on Weights

1. **Unweighted Graph**
   All edges cost same.

2. **Weighted Graph**
   Every edge has a weight.

---

### c) Based on Cycles

* **Acyclic** (No cycle)
* **Cyclic** (Cycle exists)

---

### d) Special Graphs

* **Tree** → connected + acyclic + n nodes, n-1 edges
* **DAG** → Directed Acyclic Graph
* **Complete Graph** → every node connected to every node
* **Bipartite Graph** → nodes can be split into 2 color groups without conflict

---

# PART 2 — GRAPH REPRESENTATION (Most Important Foundation)

Algorithms don’t work on “drawings”.
They work on stored data.

So first question is always:

> How is the graph stored in memory?

There are **3 ways** to store a graph:

---

## 1. Adjacency List (Most used)

#### Idea
For every node, store a list of nodes it is connected to.

#### Example: 1 connected to 2, 3
Example graph:

```
1 → 2, 3
2 → 3
3 → 1
4 → nothing
```
Stored as:
```
1: 2, 3
2: 3
3: 1
4: empty
```

### C++ Adjacency List


```cpp
// Graph representation using adjacency list
vector<vector<int>> adj(n+1);

for(auto &edge: edges){
    int u = edge[0];
    int v = edge[1];

    adj[u].push_back(v);     // directed
    adj[v].push_back(u);     // remove if graph is directed
}
```

- Complete Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// ⭐ Approach 1: Adjacency List representation

int main()
{
    int n = 4; // number of nodes
    vector<vector<int>> edges = {
        {1, 2},
        {1, 3},
        {2, 3},
        {3, 1}
    };

    // adj[i] stores all nodes connected to i
    vector<vector<int>> adj(n + 1);

    for (auto &edge : edges)
    {
        int u = edge[0];
        int v = edge[1];

        adj[u].push_back(v);   // directed edge
        // adj[v].push_back(u); // uncomment for undirected graph
    }

    return 0;
}

```

**Pros**:

* Very efficient
* Good for BFS/DFS
* Best for competitive programming

**Cons**:

* Not good for dense graphs (use matrix)

### Why adjacency list is MOST USED

* Time Complexity
    * BFS / DFS → O(V + E) (optimal)

* Space
    * Stores only actual edges
    * Very efficient for sparse graphs
---

## 2. Adjacency Matrix

#### Idea

Use a 2D array.

* adj[u][v] = 1 → edge exists
* 0 → no edge

Example:
```
    1 2 3
1 [ 0 1 1 ]
2 [ 1 0 1 ]
3 [ 1 1 0 ]
```

### C++ Code

```cpp
int adj[n+1][n+1] = {0};

for(auto &e: edges){
    int u = e[0], v = e[1];
    adj[u][v] = 1;
    adj[v][u] = 1;
}
```

* Complete code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// ⭐ Approach 2: Adjacency Matrix representation

int main()
{
    int n = 3;
    int adj[n + 1][n + 1] = {0};

    vector<vector<int>> edges = {
        {1, 2},
        {2, 3},
        {1, 3}
    };

    for (auto &e : edges)
    {
        int u = e[0], v = e[1];
        adj[u][v] = 1;
        adj[v][u] = 1; // undirected
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Pros**

* Edge check in O(1)
* Simple logic

**Cons (VERY IMPORTANT)**
* Space → O(n²)
* Impossible for large graphs (n = 10^5)

**Interview rule**
> Never use adjacency matrix unless graph is small or explicitly asked.
---

## 3. Edge List

```
(1,2), (2,3), (1,3)
```

**Used in**:

* Kruskal
* DSU problems
* MST problems

---

# PART 3 — DEGREE OF A NODE

### Undirected graph

`degree(v)` = number of edges connected to v

### Directed graph

* `in-degree(v)` = coming edges
* `out-degree(v)` = outgoing edges

Used in **Topo Sort**, **Kahn’s Algorithm**, **Safe state detection**, etc.

---

# PART 4 — CONNECTED COMPONENTS

Two nodes belong to same component if:

* They are reachable from each other
* They lie in the same connected subgraph

Example:

```
Component 1: 1—2—3
Component 2: 4—5
Component 3: 6 alone
```

**Number of Components**
= number of BFS/DFS calls needed to visit all nodes.

---

# PART 5 — BFS FOUNDATION (Graph Version)

### BFS = Breadth-First Search

Used for:

* Shortest path in **unweighted graph**
* Level order traversal
* Multi-source BFS (rotten oranges, 0/1 matrix)
* Flood fill
* Cycle detection (Undirected)

### BFS Pattern (C++)

```cpp
void bfs(int start, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& vis) {
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(start);
    vis[start] = 1;

    while(!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for(int nei : adj[node]) {
            if(!vis[nei]) {
                vis[nei] = 1;
                q.push(nei);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

# PART 6 — DFS FOUNDATION

### DFS = Depth-First Search

Used for:

* Connected components
* Flood Fill
* Cycle detection (directed)
* Topological sort (DFS version)
* Counting islands
* Distinct islands
* DFS on grids

### DFS Pattern (C++)

```cpp
void dfs(int node, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& vis) {
    vis[node] = 1;

    for(int nei : adj[node]) {
        if(!vis[nei]) {
            dfs(nei, adj, vis);
        }
    }
}
```

# PART 7 — GRAPH TRAVERSAL ORDER (VERY IMPORTANT)

| BFS                    | DFS                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Uses queue             | Uses recursion/stack         |
| Level by level         | Depth first                  |
| Best for shortest path | Best for component structure |
| Faster in grids        | Good for directed cycles     |

---

# PART 8 — GRID AS GRAPH (Matrix problems foundation)

Matrix becomes graph:

* Each cell = node
* Up to 4 neighbors (or 8)
* Used in BFS/DFS for:

  * Rotting Oranges
  * 0/1 Matrix
  * Flood Fill
  * Surrounded Regions
  * Number of Islands
  * Enclaves
  * Distinct Islands

### Directions array (important)

```cpp
int dx[4] = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
int dy[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1};
```

---

# PART 9 — GRAPH CYCLE TYPES

### Undirected Cycle

Use BFS/DFS parent method.

### Directed Cycle

Use DFS recursion stack
or
Use Kahn's algorithm.

This opens door to:

* Topo Sort
* Safe States
* Alien Dictionary
* Course Schedule 1 & 2

---

# PART 10 — TOPOSORT FOUNDATION

Topological sort works only on:

* Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

Two ways:

1. **DFS Method**
2. **Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS + indegree)**

Used in:

* Course schedule
* Eventual safe states
* Alien dictionary
* DAG shortest path

---

# PART 11 — SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHMS FOUNDATION

### 1) Unweighted graph → BFS

### 2) DAG weighted → Topo order + relax

### 3) General weighted positive → Dijkstra

### 4) Negative weight edges → Bellman-Ford

### 5) Multi-source + all-pairs → Floyd-Warshall

---

# PART 12 — DISJOINT SET UNION (DSU) FOUNDATION

Used for:

* Kruskal’s MST
* Most stones removed
* Accounts merge
* Making network connected
* Number of island II
* Making a large island

Key operations:

* find(parent)
* union(u, v)

Optimization:

* Path compression
* Union by size/rank

---

# PART 13 — MINIMUM SPANNING TREE

Two main algorithms:

### 1) **Prim’s**

Grow tree using PQ

### 2) **Kruskal**

Sort edges → use DSU

---

# PART 14 — ADVANCED GRAPH ALGORITHMS

### Bridges in Graph

Articulation Points
Tarjan’s Algorithms
Kosaraju (SCC)
Tarjan SCC (on directed graph)

These are final topics.

# MODULE 1 — GenAI Basics (Core Mindset)

## **21. What is an LLM? (Large Language Model)**

---

## 1️⃣ Concept (Clear & Correct Definition)

An **LLM (Large Language Model)** is:

> **A machine learning model trained on massive text data to predict the next token (piece of a word) based on previous tokens.**

This is the **only correct definition**.

An LLM does exactly **one job**:

```
Given text so far → predict what text comes next
```

Everything else you see:

* chat
* reasoning
* coding
* agents
* tools

is **built on top of this single capability**.

---

## ❌ What an LLM is NOT (Important)

An LLM is **not**:

* a thinking brain
* a reasoning engine by default
* a database of facts
* a decision-maker
* a memory system

Those abilities come later via:

```
prompting
+ context
+ RAG
+ tools
+ agents
```

---

## 2️⃣ Why is it called “Large”?

“Large” refers to **capacity**, not intelligence.

### LLMs are large because of:

### 1. Training data size

* books
* websites
* code
* documentation

### 2. Model parameters

* millions → billions → trillions
* parameters = learned numeric weights

### 3. Context window

* ability to read thousands of tokens at once

> Large ≠ smart
> Large = **can learn more patterns**

---

## 3️⃣ Best Analogy (Lock this in)

Think of an LLM as:

> **A super-advanced autocomplete system**

You already know autocomplete:

* phone keyboard
* Gmail smart replies

LLM does the same thing, but:

* across paragraphs
* across many domains
* with deeper context

---

## 4️⃣ Internal Working (High-Level but Real)

### End-to-end flow

```
Input text
  ↓
Tokenizer (text → tokens)
  ↓
Transformer neural network
  ↓
Next-token probability distribution
  ↓
One token selected
  ↓
Token appended to input
  ↓
Repeat until output ends
```

Important:

* The model **never sees words**
* It only sees **tokens (numbers)**

---

## 5️⃣ Passive Nature of an LLM (Key Insight)

An LLM by itself is **passive**.

It:

* waits for input
* generates output
* stops

It cannot:

* call APIs
* fetch live data
* loop
* verify correctness
* remember past calls

This is why:

```
agents
RAG
tools
memory
```

exist later in your roadmap.

---

## 6️⃣ JavaScript Practice — Minimal LLM Call (Groq)

This is the **smallest possible LLM interaction**, using **Groq (your default)**.

### Example 1: Basic prompt → response

```js
// src/Topics/MODULE 1 — GenAI Basics/21-llm-basic.js
import groq from "../../../src/utils/groqClient.js";

async function run() {
  const response = await groq.chat.completions.create({
    model: "llama-3.1-8b-instant",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Explain binary search in one sentence",
      },
    ],
  });

  console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
}

await run();
```

### What this teaches

* LLM waits for input
* LLM generates text
* LLM stops

No memory.
No actions.
Pure next-token prediction.

---

## 7️⃣ Code Example — Same Question, Different Outputs

LLMs are **probabilistic**, not deterministic.

```js
import groq from "../../../src/utils/groqClient.js";

async function run() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    const res = await groq.chat.completions.create({
      model: "llama-3.1-8b-instant",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "user",
          content: "Define recursion in simple words",
        },
      ],
    });

    console.log(`Run ${i + 1}:`, res.choices[0].message.content);
  }
}

await run();
```

### Insight

Same input ≠ same output
Because the model **samples probabilities**, not fixed answers.

(This connects directly to **Topic 26 — Temperature & Sampling**.)

---

## 8️⃣ Code Example — LLM Has No Memory

```js
import groq from "../../../src/utils/groqClient.js";

async function run() {
  await groq.chat.completions.create({
    model: "llama-3.1-8b-instant",
    messages: [
      { role: "user", content: "My name is Tanish" },
    ],
  });

  const res = await groq.chat.completions.create({
    model: "llama-3.1-8b-instant",
    messages: [
      { role: "user", content: "What is my name?" },
    ],
  });

  console.log(res.choices[0].message.content);
}

await run();
```

### Expected behavior

The model does **not remember** your name.

### Why?

> **LLMs have no memory between API calls**

Memory is something **you build later** using:

* chat history
* agents
* databases

---

## 9️⃣ Mini Practice Tasks

### Task 1

Ask the model:

* explain a concept
* then explain the same concept to a child

### Task 2

Ask the same prompt 5 times and compare wording.

### Task 3

Ask a question requiring real-time data (today’s news).
Observe uncertainty or hallucination.

---

## 🔧 Mini Project — LLM Playground (Groq)

Create:

```
21-llm-playground.js
```

### Features

* read user input from terminal
* send prompt to Groq
* print response

This builds **intuition** about how passive an LLM really is.

## 10️⃣ Where This Fits in Your Roadmap

```
MODULE 1 — GenAI Basics
21. What is an LLM?  ← YOU ARE HERE
22. Tokenization
23. Prompt → Output cycle
```

If Topic 21 is solid:

* Tokenization becomes obvious
* Prompting makes sense
* RAG feels logical
* Agents stop feeling magical

---

## 11️⃣ One-Line Truth (Memorize This)

> **An LLM does not know answers.
> It predicts text that looks like a good answer.**

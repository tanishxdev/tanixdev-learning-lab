# GenAI Journey
### *A curated, structured, professionally organized learning path for mastering Generative AI using JavaScript + Node.js.*

---


## 🌟 About This Repository

I created this roadmap after gathering topics from multiple high-quality sources, industry interviews, company expectations, GenAI engineering job descriptions, and Udemy course content.

With the help of AI, I refined, expanded, and reorganized everything into a **clean, module-wise, chapter-wise structured learning path**.

This repo exists for two purposes:

1. **My own deep learning** — to follow a clear, focused, long-term GenAI mastery plan.
2. **For anyone else building GenAI skills** — if this roadmap helps you, feel free to follow along module by module.

This roadmap focuses on **JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, LangChainJS, LangGraph, MCP**, and modern APIs like **Gemini, OpenAI, Groq**, without unnecessary Python-specific complexity.

##### 🧪 Hands-On Projects 

This repository also contains **practical projects** built while progressing through the roadmap.  
Each project is designed to **solidify concepts**, not just demonstrate APIs.

---

# 🔨 Pre-requisites
 - Language : **JavaScript/TypeScript** and Node.js basics are required to start.

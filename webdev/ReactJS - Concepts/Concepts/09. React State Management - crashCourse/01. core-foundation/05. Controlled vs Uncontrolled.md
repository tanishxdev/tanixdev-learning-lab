# PHASE 1 – SUBTOPIC 5  
## Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

This topic connects **state + forms + real-world React behaviour**.  
Understanding this will make your form logic clean and predictable.

New focused file: **ControlledVsUncontrolled.jsx**

## 1. Core Concept

### Controlled Component
A form element whose value is fully controlled by React state.

- Input value comes from state
- On every change, state updates
- State = single source of truth

### Uncontrolled Component
A form element that manages its own internal state using DOM.

- Value read using refs
- React does NOT control it directly

---

## 2. Mental Model

### Controlled
```
User types → React state updates → UI updates
```
React is in control.

### Uncontrolled
```
User types → DOM stores value → React reads when needed
```
Browser is in control.

---

## 3. Real-life Analogy

### Controlled
Like a teacher writing your answers dictation-style.
You only write what teacher allows.

### Uncontrolled
Like you filling form freely and teacher checks it later.

---

## 4. Comparison Table

| Aspect | Controlled | Uncontrolled |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Who controls value | React State | DOM |
| Data flow | Predictable | Less predictable |
| Validation | Easy | Harder |
| Preferred | ✅ Yes | ❌ Rarely |

---

## 5. Code Demonstration

### ControlledVsUncontrolled.jsx

```javascript
import React, { useState, useRef } from "react";

/*
====================================================
CONTROLLED vs UNCONTROLLED COMPONENT DEMO
====================================================
*/

function ControlledVsUncontrolled() {

  // CONTROLLED: state controls input value
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  // UNCONTROLLED: ref to access DOM element directly
  const emailRef = useRef();

  function handleControlledChange(event) {
    setName(event.target.value);
  }

  function handleSubmit() {
    console.log("Controlled Name:", name);
    console.log("Uncontrolled Email:", emailRef.current.value);
  }

  return (
    <div>

      <h2>Controlled Input</h2>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={name}
        onChange={handleControlledChange}
        placeholder="Enter name"
      />

      <h2>Uncontrolled Input</h2>
      <input
        type="email"
        ref={emailRef}
        placeholder="Enter email"
      />

      <br /><br />

      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>
        Submit
      </button>

    </div>
  );
}

export default ControlledVsUncontrolled;
```

---

## 6. Line-by-line Understanding

### Controlled Input

```javascript
value={name}
onChange={handleControlledChange}
```
- Input reflects React state
- React updates state on every keystroke

### Uncontrolled Input

```javascript
ref={emailRef}
```
- Value stored by DOM
- React accesses only when needed

---

## 7. Dry Run

### Controlled Flow
1. User types "John"
2. onChange triggers
3. setName("John")
4. State updates
5. UI re-renders

### Uncontrolled Flow
1. User types email
2. DOM stores value
3. React reads it during submit

---

## 8. Why Controlled is Preferred

- Real-time validation
- Sync with other components
- Predictable state flow
- Easier debugging

---

## 9. When Uncontrolled is Useful

- Quick form prototypes
- Legacy code
- File inputs (sometimes)

But for production apps → Controlled is the standard.

---

## 10. Common Mistakes

❌ Mixing both styles randomly  
❌ Forgetting value prop for controlled input  
❌ Using uncontrolled when validation is needed

---

## 11. Key Takeaways

- Controlled = React owns the data  
- Uncontrolled = DOM owns the data  
- Prefer controlled for real apps  
- useRef helps in uncontrolled approach

---

## Mini Practice

Modify ControlledVsUncontrolled.jsx:
1. Add another controlled input for password
2. Add button to clear controlled inputs
3. Console log both values

---

## Interview Questions (Focused)

1. Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
2. Why are controlled components preferred?
3. What role does useRef play?
4. When should we use uncontrolled inputs?
5. How does data flow differ?

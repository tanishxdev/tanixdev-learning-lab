# PHASE 1 – SUBTOPIC 4

## React Re-render Cycle Explained (How & Why UI Updates)

This topic is critical.
It explains what **actually happens** when state changes.

---

## Folder Structure (still clean)

```
components
└── state management
    ├── StateCounter.jsx
    ├── PropsVsState.jsx
    ├── UseStateDeep.jsx
    └── ReRenderCycle.jsx
```

New focused file: **ReRenderCycle.jsx**

---

## 1. Concept

A re-render happens when React decides a component must update its UI because something changed.

React re-renders when:

* State changes
* Props change
* Parent re-renders

Re-render = React runs the component function again.

---

## 2. Core Mental Model

React Component = Normal JavaScript Function

Every re-render:

```
Component() runs again
Calculates new JSX
Compares with old UI (Virtual DOM)
Updates only changed parts
```

So React is not refreshing the page.
It is re-executing the component logic.

---

## 3. Re-render Flow (Step-by-step)

```
Initial Render:
Component function runs
JSX created
UI painted

State change occurs:
setState called
React schedules re-render
Component function runs again
New JSX generated
React compares old vs new
Only differences updated on screen
```

---

## 4. What Triggers Re-render

| Trigger                | Causes Re-render |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| setState               | ✅ Yes            |
| New props              | ✅ Yes            |
| Normal variable change | ❌ No             |
| DOM change manually    | ❌ No             |

## 5. Practical Demonstration Code

### ReRenderCycle.jsx

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

/*
====================================================
RE-RENDER CYCLE DEMO
Helps observe how many times component runs
====================================================
*/

function ReRenderCycle() {

  // This log shows when component function runs
  console.log("Component Rendered");

  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>

      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Increase Count
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ReRenderCycle;
```

---

## 6. Observation (Open Browser Console)

When page loads:

```
Component Rendered
```

Each button click:

```
Component Rendered
```

This proves:
👉 Entire component function executes again on every state change.

---

## 7. Dry Run Timeline

### Initial Load

```
ReRenderCycle() runs
count = 0
UI rendered
```

### Button Click

```
handleClick()
setCount(1)
React triggers re-render
ReRenderCycle() runs again
count = 1
UI updates
```

This loop repeats.

---

## 8. Why React Re-renders Entire Function

Because React's philosophy is:

> UI should always represent current state

So it rebuilds UI snapshot every time.

This makes UI predictable and reliable.

---

## 9. Common Misconceptions

❌ React updates only changed lines
✅ React re-runs whole component but optimises DOM changes

❌ setState updates immediately
✅ State updates are batched and async

---

## 10. Important Performance Insight

Re-render ≠ Slow

React uses:

* Virtual DOM
* Diffing algorithm
* Efficient reconciliation

So even frequent renders are optimized.

---

## 11. Debugging Trick

Use console.log like this:

```js
console.log("Render count increased");
```

Great way to track unnecessary re-renders.

---

## 12. Key Takeaways

* Re-render = component function runs again
* Triggered by state or props change
* JSX recalculated each time
* Only actual DOM differences update

---

## Mini Practice

Modify ReRenderCycle.jsx:

* Add another state variable
* Add log for both states
* Observe console behavior on each change

This will reinforce the cycle understanding.

## Interview Questions

1. What causes a re-render in React?
2. Does React reload the whole page on re-render?
3. What happens internally during re-render?
4. How React optimizes re-rendering?
5. What is Virtual DOM role here?

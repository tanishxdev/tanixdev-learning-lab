# dynamicParams in Next.js

## Why This Topic Exists

### The Problem

You just learned `generateStaticParams`.

That solved:

* How dynamic routes can be **statically generated**
* How Next.js knows **which params exist at build time**

But a **very important edge case** remains:

> **What if a user visits a dynamic route that was NOT generated at build time?**

Example:

You generated:

```
/blog/react-basics
/blog/nextjs-routing
```

User visits:

```
/blog/unknown-post
```

Questions:

* Should this be a 404?
* Should Next.js try to render it dynamically?
* Can we control this behavior?

---

### The Solution

Next.js gives us **`dynamicParams`**.

Key idea:

> **`dynamicParams` controls whether unknown dynamic route params are allowed or not.**

---

## What Is `dynamicParams`

### Definition

`dynamicParams` is a route-level configuration that tells Next.js:

> **Whether to allow rendering of dynamic routes that were not generated by `generateStaticParams`.**

It answers:

* “Do all valid params exist at build time?”
* Or “Can new params appear later?”

---

### Analogy

Think of a **guest list for an event**:

* `dynamicParams = false` → Only invited guests allowed
* `dynamicParams = true` → Walk-ins allowed

---

### Visual / Line Diagram Explanation

```
Request → /blog/some-slug
         ↓
Is slug in generateStaticParams?
         ↓
YES → serve static page
NO  → depends on dynamicParams
```

---

## Default Behavior

### Important Rule

> **By default, `dynamicParams = true`.**

Meaning:

* Unknown params are allowed
* Page will be rendered dynamically if needed

---

## Using `dynamicParams = false`

### What It Means

```tsx
export const dynamicParams = false;
```

This tells Next.js:

> “Only allow params returned by `generateStaticParams`.
> Anything else → 404.”

---

### Example

#### File Structure

```
src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
```

---

#### Code

```tsx
export const dynamicParams = false;

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  return [
    { slug: "react-basics" },
    { slug: "nextjs-routing" },
  ];
}

export default function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: { slug: string };
}) {
  return <h1>{params.slug}</h1>;
}
```

---

### Behavior

| URL                    | Result        |
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| `/blog/react-basics`   | ✅ Static page |
| `/blog/nextjs-routing` | ✅ Static page |
| `/blog/unknown`        | ❌ 404         |

No dynamic rendering happens.

---

## Using `dynamicParams = true`

### What It Means

```tsx
export const dynamicParams = true;
```

This allows:

* Params not known at build time
* Dynamic rendering for new routes

---

### Example Scenario

You have a blog where:

* Old posts exist at build time
* New posts are added later

Then:

* Old posts → static
* New posts → dynamic

This is useful for:

* CMS-driven content
* Growing platforms

---

## How `dynamicParams` Works with Rendering

### Case 1: Static Param

```
/blog/react-basics
```

* Exists in `generateStaticParams`
* Served as static HTML

---

### Case 2: Unknown Param (dynamicParams = true)

```
/blog/new-post
```

* Not generated at build time
* Next.js renders it **dynamically**
* Server Components run at request time

---

### Case 3: Unknown Param (dynamicParams = false)

```
/blog/new-post
```

* Immediately 404
* No server rendering

---

## dynamicParams vs generateStaticParams (Clear Comparison)

| Feature      | generateStaticParams     | dynamicParams                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Purpose      | Define known params      | Allow or block unknown params |
| Runs         | Build time               | Request-time decision         |
| Controls     | Which pages are prebuilt | Fallback behavior             |
| Common usage | Blogs, docs              | Strict vs flexible routing    |

They are **designed to work together**.

---

## Real-Life Use Cases

### Use `dynamicParams = false` When:

* Content set is fixed
* Docs, versioned content
* Marketing pages
* You want strict 404s

---

### Use `dynamicParams = true` When:

* Content grows over time
* CMS-based blogs
* User-generated content

---

## Common Misunderstandings

### Misunderstanding 1: “dynamicParams makes everything dynamic”

❌ Wrong
Only **unknown params** become dynamic.

---

### Misunderstanding 2: “dynamicParams replaces generateStaticParams”

❌ Wrong
They solve **different problems**.

---

### Misunderstanding 3: “dynamicParams runs code”

❌ Wrong
It’s a **configuration flag**, not a function.

---

## What We Are NOT Covering Yet

Not covered yet:

* Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
* Revalidation
* Fine-grained caching

Those come later.

---

## Summary

* `dynamicParams` controls fallback behavior
* Default is `true`
* `false` enforces strict static routes
* Works together with `generateStaticParams`
* Critical for scalable content systems

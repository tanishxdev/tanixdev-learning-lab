# UML Relationships – Easy Understanding

Socho tumhari zindagi ek system hai. Tum, tumhara bag, mobile, dost — sab objects hain. Inke beech jo connection hota hai wahi **relationship** hai.

---

## 1. Association – Normal Connection

👉 Meaning: Bas koi relation hai, ownership nahi.

**Example:**
Student ↔ Teacher
Student teacher se padhta hai, par teacher student ka malik nahi hai.

**Logic:**

* Dono alag-alag bhi exist kar sakte hain
* Sirf interaction hai

Diagram idea:

```
Student -------- Teacher
```

Real life:
You and your neighbour = Association

---

## 2. Aggregation – Weak Whole-Part

👉 Meaning: Ek cheez dusri ka hissa hai, par alag bhi reh sakti hai.

**Example:**
Department has Teachers

Department hata do, teacher fir bhi zinda rahega.

Soch:

* College band ho jaye
* Teacher fir bhi teacher hi rahega

🔥 Weak relation

Diagram idea:

```
Department ◇---- Teacher
```

## 3. Composition – Strong Whole-Part

👉 Meaning: Part bina whole ke exist hi nahi karta

**Example:**
House has Rooms

Agar house destroy ho gaya → rooms bhi khatam.

Soch:

* Mobile phone toot gaya
* Uska screen bhi useless

🔥 Strong relation

Diagram idea:

```
House ◆---- Room
```

## 4. Inheritance – IS-A Relationship

👉 Meaning: Child class is type of Parent

**Example:**
Dog is an Animal

Dog inherits properties of Animal

Soch:
Animal = Parent
Dog = Child

Every Dog is an Animal ✅
Every Animal is Dog ❌

Diagram:

```
Dog ----|> Animal
```

Keyword: IS-A

---

## 5. Dependency – Temporary Use

👉 Meaning: Ek class dusri ko temporarily use karti hai.

**Example:**
Printer uses Ink

Printer kaam karta hai ink ke saath, par printer ink ka owner nahi hai.

Short-term relation.

Diagram:

```
Printer - - - > Ink
```

# Ultra Simple Summary Table

| Relationship | Real Meaning     | Example           | Strength   |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Association  | Just connection  | Student - Teacher | Normal     |
| Aggregation  | Weak ownership   | Dept - Teacher    | Weak       |
| Composition  | Strong ownership | House - Room      | Strong     |
| Inheritance  | IS-A             | Dog is Animal     | Hierarchy  |
| Dependency   | Temporary use    | Printer uses Ink  | Short-term |

# One Line Trick to Remember

Association = Know each other
Aggregation = Has-a (weak)
Composition = Has-a (strong, dies together)
Inheritance = Is-a
Dependency = Uses-a

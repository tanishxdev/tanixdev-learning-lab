# Common Mistakes & Interview Traps (Node Package Manager – npm)

---

## 1. Thinking npm is Part of Node.js Runtime ❌

### Mistake

Saying:

> “npm runs JavaScript code.”

### Reality

* **Node.js** runs JavaScript
* **npm** only manages packages

Correct mental separation:

```
Node.js → executes JS
npm     → installs & manages JS code
```

### Interview Trap

**Q:** Does npm execute JavaScript files?
**Answer:**
“No. Node.js executes JavaScript. npm is only a package manager.”

---

## 2. Confusing `package.json` and `package-lock.json` ❌

### Mistake

Believing both files do the same thing.

### Reality

| File                | Purpose                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `package.json`      | Declares dependencies & version ranges |
| `package-lock.json` | Locks exact dependency tree            |

Mental model:

```
package.json      → intent
package-lock.json → reality
```

### Interview Trap

**Q:** Why is `package-lock.json` important?
**Answer:**
“It ensures consistent dependency versions across environments.”

---

## 3. Deleting `package-lock.json` Without Understanding ❌

### Mistake

Deleting `package-lock.json` to “fix issues”.

### Reality

* Deleting it can:

  * change dependency versions
  * introduce unexpected bugs
* Should only be regenerated intentionally

### Interview Trap

**Q:** Should `package-lock.json` be committed to Git?
**Answer:**
“Yes. It ensures reproducible installs.”

---

## 4. Committing `node_modules` to Git ❌

### Mistake

Pushing `node_modules` to GitHub.

### Reality

* `node_modules` is:

  * OS-dependent
  * large
  * auto-generated

Correct practice:

```gitignore
node_modules/
```

### Interview Trap

**Q:** Why shouldn’t `node_modules` be committed?
**Answer:**
“Because it can be regenerated using `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.”

---

## 5. Not Understanding Version Symbols (`^` and `~`) ❌

### Mistake

Ignoring version ranges.

Example:

```json
"lodash": "^4.17.21"
```

### Reality

| Symbol | Meaning                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `^`    | Allows minor & patch updates |
| `~`    | Allows patch updates only    |
| exact  | Locks version completely     |

### Interview Trap

**Q:** What does `^4.17.21` mean?
**Answer:**
“It allows backward-compatible updates but prevents breaking changes.”

---

## 6. Installing Packages Globally When Not Needed ❌

### Mistake

Running:

```bash
npm install -g axios
```

### Reality

* Global installs are for:

  * CLI tools (nodemon, eslint)
* App libraries should be **local**

### Interview Trap

**Q:** When should packages be installed globally?
**Answer:**
“When they are used as CLI tools, not inside application code.”

---

## 7. Assuming `require()` Works Without `node_modules` ❌

### Mistake

Expecting:

```js
require('axios')
```

to work without installing axios.

### Reality

* Node looks inside `node_modules`
* npm must install the package first

### Interview Trap

**Q:** How does Node find third-party packages?
**Answer:**
“By searching inside the `node_modules` directory.”

---

## 8. Mixing CommonJS and ES Modules Incorrectly ❌

### Mistake

Using:

```js
require('axios')
```

inside `.mjs` file.

### Reality

* `.js` → CommonJS by default
* `.mjs` → ES Modules
* Syntax must match module type

### Interview Trap

**Q:** Why does `require` fail in `.mjs` files?
**Answer:**
“Because `.mjs` uses ES module syntax, not CommonJS.”

---

## 9. Forgetting `npm install` After Cloning a Project ❌

### Mistake

Running:

```bash
node app.js
```

immediately after cloning.

### Reality

* `node_modules` is missing
* Must run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Interview Trap

**Q:** What is the first command after cloning a Node project?
**Answer:**
“`npm install` to install dependencies.”

---

## 10. Editing `node_modules` Directly ❌

### Mistake

Modifying library code inside `node_modules`.

### Reality

* Changes are lost on reinstall
* Libraries should be configured, not edited

### Interview Trap

**Q:** Why shouldn’t we modify `node_modules` directly?
**Answer:**
“Because changes are temporary and overwritten during installs.”

---

## 11. Assuming npm Packages Are Always Safe ❌

### Mistake

Blindly installing any package.

### Reality

* npm is open-source
* Packages can:

  * be unmaintained
  * contain vulnerabilities

Best practice:

* Check popularity
* Check last update
* Audit dependencies

### Interview Trap

**Q:** How do you ensure dependency safety?
**Answer:**
“By auditing packages and using trusted, well-maintained libraries.”

---

## 12. Not Using npm Scripts ❌

### Mistake

Running long commands manually.

### Reality

* npm scripts provide:

  * consistency
  * simplicity
  * automation

Example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js"
}
```

Run:

```bash
npm run start
```

### Interview Trap

**Q:** Why use npm scripts?
**Answer:**
“They standardize commands and simplify project execution.”

---

## Final Interview One-Liners (Revise Before Interview)

* npm is a package manager, not a runtime
* `package.json` declares dependencies
* `package-lock.json` locks exact versions
* `node_modules` is auto-generated
* Local installs are for app code
* Global installs are for CLI tools
* Version ranges matter
* Never commit `node_modules`

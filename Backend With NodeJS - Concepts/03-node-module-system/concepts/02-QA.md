# Common Mistakes & Interview Traps (Node.js Basics)

---

## 1. Thinking Node.js is a Framework ❌

### Mistake

Many beginners say:

> “Node.js is a backend framework like Express.”

### Reality

* **Node.js is NOT a framework**
* It is a **JavaScript runtime**

### Correct mental model

* Node.js = environment to run JavaScript
* Express = framework built **on top of Node.js**

```
JavaScript
   ↓
Node.js (runtime)
   ↓
Express / Fastify / NestJS (frameworks)
```

### Interview trap

**Q:** Is Node.js a framework?
**Correct answer:**
“No. Node.js is a runtime that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser.”

---

## 2. Confusing Browser JavaScript with Node.js JavaScript ❌

### Mistake

Assuming everything in browser JS works in Node.js.

Example wrong assumption:

```js
alert("Hello");
document.getElementById("id");
```

### Reality

* Browser JS has:

  * DOM
  * window
  * alert
* Node.js has:

  * fs
  * os
  * path
  * process

### Correct mental model

| Environment | APIs available  |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| Browser     | DOM, window     |
| Node.js     | OS, FS, Network |

### Interview trap

**Q:** Why does `document` not work in Node.js?
**Answer:**
“Because Node.js does not run inside a browser and does not have DOM APIs.”

---

## 3. Forgetting to Use `node` Command ❌

### Mistake

Trying to run JS file directly:

```bash
hello-world.js
```

### Correct way

```bash
node hello-world.js
```

### Why this matters

* OS does not understand `.js`
* Node is the **interpreter**

### Interview trap

**Q:** How does Node execute a JS file?
**Answer:**
“Using the `node` command, which passes the file to the V8 engine.”

---

## 4. Thinking npm is Required to Run JavaScript ❌

### Mistake

Believing npm is needed to execute JS files.

### Reality

* npm is **not required** to run JS
* npm is only needed when:

  * installing packages
  * managing dependencies

### Correct separation

| Tool | Purpose         |
| ---- | --------------- |
| node | Run JS          |
| npm  | Manage packages |

### Interview trap

**Q:** Can you run Node.js code without npm?
**Answer:**
“Yes. npm is optional unless external libraries are required.”

---

## 5. Misunderstanding Built-in vs External Modules ❌

### Mistake

Trying to install core modules:

```bash
npm install os
```

### Reality

* Core modules come **with Node.js**
* Examples:

  * fs
  * os
  * path
  * http

### Correct usage

```js
const os = require("os");
```

No installation needed.

### Interview trap

**Q:** Where does Node get the `fs` module from?
**Answer:**
“It is bundled inside Node.js itself.”

---

## 6. Assuming Node is Multi-Threaded Like Java ❌

### Mistake

Thinking Node creates a new thread for each request.

### Reality

* Node.js is **single-threaded**
* Uses:

  * Event loop
  * Async callbacks
  * Background threads internally (libuv)

### Correct mental model

```
Single JS Thread
      ↓
Event Loop
      ↓
Async I/O handled in background
```

### Interview trap

**Q:** Is Node.js single-threaded or multi-threaded?
**Answer:**
“Single-threaded for JS execution, but uses background threads for I/O.”

---

## 7. Blocking the Event Loop with Synchronous Code ❌

### Mistake

Using heavy synchronous operations:

```js
fs.readFileSync("big-file.txt");
```

### Problem

* Blocks the entire process
* No other code runs meanwhile

### Better approach

```js
fs.readFile("big-file.txt", callback);
```

### Interview trap

**Q:** Why should we avoid sync methods in Node.js?
**Answer:**
“Because they block the event loop and reduce performance.”

---

## 8. Not Understanding Where `console.log` Goes ❌

### Mistake

Thinking `console.log` behaves the same everywhere.

### Reality

* Browser → DevTools console
* Node.js → Terminal stdout

### Interview trap

**Q:** Where does `console.log` output go in Node.js?
**Answer:**
“To standard output (terminal).”

---

## 9. Ignoring Node Version Management ❌

### Mistake

Using only one global Node version forever.

### Problem

* Different projects require different Node versions
* Production often uses older LTS

### Solution

* Use **NVM**

### Interview trap

**Q:** Why do teams use NVM?
**Answer:**
“To manage multiple Node versions across different projects.”

---

## 10. Thinking Node Automatically Creates `package.json` ❌

### Mistake

Expecting `package.json` to exist automatically.

### Reality

* Node does **not** create it
* npm creates it using:

```bash
npm init
```

### Interview trap

**Q:** When is `package.json` created?
**Answer:**
“When we initialize a project using npm.”

---

## Final Interview Summary (One-Liners)

* Node.js is a **runtime**, not a framework
* npm is a **package manager**, not a runtime
* Browser JS ≠ Node.js JS
* Core modules don’t need installation
* Node executes JS using the **V8 engine**
* Node is single-threaded with async I/O
* Sync code blocks the event loop
* NVM prevents version conflicts

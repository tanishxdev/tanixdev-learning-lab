# REACT STATE MANAGEMENT – COMPLETE COURSE (From Absolute Basics)

## Course Philosophy (How you will learn)

* You will understand **WHY state exists before HOW to use it**
* Every concept will follow this structure:

```
Concept
Intuition
Real-life Analogy
Pseudocode
Code (Fully Commented)
Dry Run
Common Bugs
Interview Questions
```

* We’ll move from:

```
Thinking in state → Local state → Lifting state → Context → Global State → Advanced tools
```

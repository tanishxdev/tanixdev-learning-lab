# PHASE 1 – SUBTOPIC 2

## Props vs State – Real Difference (Mental Model + Practical Flow)

We will stay slow and very clear here because this is where most React confusion starts.

### Folder Structure (still clean & organised)

```
components
└── state management
    ├── StateCounter.jsx
    └── PropsVsState.jsx
```

We introduce a new file to visualise the difference properly.

---

## 1. Concept (Straight to the point)

### STATE

* Owned by the component itself
* Can change
* Managed inside the component
* Used for data that is dynamic

### PROPS

* Passed from parent to child
* Read-only
* Cannot be changed by child
* Used for configuration / communication

---

## 2. Core Mental Model

Think like this:

```
STATE  → INTERNAL MEMORY (private)
PROPS  → EXTERNAL INPUT (given)
```

### Simple Definition

| Aspect      | State                    | Props                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Ownership   | Component itself         | Parent component             |
| Mutability  | Can change               | Read-only                    |
| Purpose     | Manage internal behavior | Pass data between components |
| Who updates | setState / setter        | Parent only                  |

---

## 3. Real-life Analogy

### Student Report Card System

Teacher (Parent component)
Student (Child component)

Teacher sends marks:
→ These are PROPS (student cannot change them)

Student’s mood / energy:
→ That is STATE (student controls it)

---

## 4. Visual Flow

```
Parent Component
   |
   |  passes data (props)
   ↓
Child Component
   |
   |  manages its own internal logic (state)
```

---

## 5. Why This Distinction Matters

If you confuse props and state:

* You create buggy UI
* You break data flow
* You lose component predictability

Correct React mental flow:

```
Data flows DOWN via props  
Events flow UP via functions
```

---

## 6. Practical Code Example

### PropsVsState.jsx

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

/*
====================================================
PROPS VS STATE DEMONSTRATION
====================================================
Parent component sends a label using props.
Child component manages counter using state.
====================================================
*/

function CounterDisplay({ title }) {
  // STATE: internal, managed by component itself
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function increaseCount() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>

      {/* PROPS: received from parent */}
      <h2>{title}</h2>

      {/* STATE: internal changing data */}
      <p>Count: {count}</p>

      <button onClick={increaseCount}>
        Increase
      </button>

    </div>
  );
}

/*
Parent Component
This sends data to child using PROPS
*/
function PropsVsState() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CounterDisplay title="Counter using Props + State" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default PropsVsState;
```

---

## 7. Line-by-line Breakdown

```javascript
function CounterDisplay({ title }) {
```

* `title` is a prop
* Passed by parent
* Cannot be modified here

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

* `count` is state
* Managed by this component
* Can change over time

---

## 8. Dry Run

Parent renders:

```
title = "Counter using Props + State"
```

Child renders:

```
title prop → stays constant
count state → starts at 0
```

Button click:

```
setCount(0 + 1)
count becomes 1
UI updates
```

Observe:

* title never changes
* count updates dynamically

This is key difference.

---

## 9. Common Mistakes Beginners Make

### ❌ Trying to change props

```js
title = "New Title"; // NOT ALLOWED
```

### ✅ Correct approach

If child needs to modify data:
-> Ask parent via callback

(This will be covered naturally in later lessons)

---

## 10. Summary (Crystallised Understanding)

* Props = incoming data from parent
* State = internal data of component
* Props are immutable
* State is mutable via setter

Think:

```
Props = What I get
State = What I manage
```

---

## 11. Mini Practice

Modify PropsVsState.jsx:

1. Pass a second prop `subtitle`
2. Display it below the main title
3. Keep count logic unchanged

This will reinforce data flow.

---

## Interview Questions (Focused)

1. Difference between props and state?
2. Can child modify props?
3. Why is props immutable?
4. When to use state instead of props?
5. How does data flow in React?

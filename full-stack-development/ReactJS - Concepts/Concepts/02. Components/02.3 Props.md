# PROPS

(Problem → Concept → Folder → Code → Explanation → Output)

## 1. Problem Without Props

Without props, components cannot receive data from outside.

This leads to:

* Hardcoded data inside components
* No dynamic communication
* No reusability with different data
* Tight coupling between UI and data

Example problem:
Every profile card shows same name because data is fixed inside component.

---

## 2. Core Concept

Props = Properties

Definition:

> Props are a way to pass data from parent component to child component.

Important rules:

* Props are READ-ONLY
* Child cannot change props
* Data flows one-way (Parent → Child)

---

## 3. Real-World Intuition

Think of components as machines.

Props are inputs:

* Same machine
* Different input
* Different output

---

## 4. Folder Structure

```
src/
  components/
    UserCard.jsx
  App.jsx
  main.jsx
```

---

## 5. Code Implementation

### A. Child Component Receiving Props

**src/components/UserCard.jsx**

```jsx
// UserCard.jsx
// This component receives props from parent.

function UserCard(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>User Information</h3>
      <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
      <p>Role: {props.role}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserCard;
```

Explanation:

* props is an object
* Accessed using props.propertyName

---

### B. Parent Component Passing Props

**src/App.jsx**

```jsx
import UserCard from "./components/UserCard";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Props Concept</h1>

      <UserCard 
        name="Tanish"
        age={21}
        role="Frontend Developer"
      />

      <UserCard 
        name="Rahul"
        age={23}
        role="Backend Developer"
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

## 6. How Props Flow Works

Flow:

```
Parent App → passes data → Child UserCard → displays data
```

React creates two different cards:

* One for Tanish
* One for Rahul

Same component, different data.

---

## 7. Output On Screen

Props Concept

User Information
Name: Tanish
Age: 21
Role: Frontend Developer

User Information
Name: Rahul
Age: 23
Role: Backend Developer

## 8. Why Props Matter

| Problem          | Props Solution                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Static data      | Dynamic data                       |
| No flexibility   | Reusable components                |
| Code duplication | Same component with different data |
| Tight coupling   | Loose modular UI                   |

---

## 9. Key Rules of Props

| Rule         | Meaning                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| One-way flow | Parent → Child                      |
| Read-only    | Cannot modify inside child          |
| Reusable     | Same component supports many inputs |
| Immutable    | Should not be changed by child      |

---

## 10. Summary

| Concept   | Explanation                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Props     | Data passed to components     |
| Purpose   | Customise reusable components |
| Direction | Parent to Child               |
| Result    | Dynamic scalable UI           |

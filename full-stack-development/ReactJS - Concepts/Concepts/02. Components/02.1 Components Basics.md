# COMPONENTS

(Last year style: Concept → Problem → Code → Folder → Explanation)

---

## 1. Problem Before Components

Without components (pure HTML/JS), you must write everything in one file:

* Huge HTML files
* Repeated UI
* No reusability
* Hard to maintain
* Hard to update one part of UI
* Code repetition everywhere

Example problem:
If you need the same card in 10 places, you must copy-paste 10 times.

## 2. What Are Components?

A **component is a reusable UI function**.

Definition:

> A component is just a function that returns UI (JSX).

React sees components as:

* Independent
* Reusable
* Self-contained UI blocks

---

## 3. Real-World Intuition

Think of components like Lego blocks.

One Lego block = one UI piece
Combine Lego blocks = full UI.

## 4. Folder Structure for This Chapter

```
src/
  components/
    Greeting.jsx
  App.jsx
  main.jsx
```

---

## 5. Code Example

### A. Greeting Component (modular file)

**src/components/Greeting.jsx**

```jsx
// Greeting.jsx
// This component displays a simple message.
// Components must start with capital letters.

function Greeting() {
  return (
    <h2>Welcome to React Components</h2>
  );
}

export default Greeting;
```

Explanation:

* A simple function.
* Returns JSX.
* Exported to be used anywhere.

---

### B. Using Component Inside App

**src/App.jsx**

```jsx
// App.jsx
// Importing our component to use inside main UI.

import Greeting from "./components/Greeting";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React Concepts</h1>
      <Greeting />  {/* Using our component */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Explanation:

* We import the component.
* Use it like HTML tag: `<Greeting />`.

---

### C. Main Entry

**src/main.jsx**

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
  .render(<App />);
```

---

## 6. Output

The browser will show:

React Concepts
Welcome to React Components

## 7. Why Components Matter

| Concept         | Explanation                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Reusability     | Same UI used anywhere                  |
| Maintainability | Update one file → reflected everywhere |
| Separation      | Split UI in logical pieces             |
| Scalability     | Needed for large applications          |
| Clean Code      | Shorter, readable, predictable code    |

# 14.2 COMPONENTS VS PAGES

This is one of the most important concepts in scalable React architecture.
Beginners mix everything in one folder, but **professionals strictly separate Components and Pages**.

Let’s go step-by-step.

---

# 1. What are **Pages** in React?

Pages are **route-level** UI screens.

Meaning:

* Every page is directly connected to a route (URL)
* Pages represent entire screens or sections of your app
* Pages DO NOT contain small UI components
* Pages COMBINE components to form a screen

Examples of pages:

* HomePage
* LoginPage
* ProductListPage
* ProductDetailPage
* CartPage
* DashboardPage
* ProfilePage
* SettingsPage

Pages live in their own folder:

```
src/pages/
    HomePage.jsx
    LoginPage.jsx
    ProductPage.jsx
    ProductDetailPage.jsx
```

---

# 2. What are **Components** in React?

Components are **reusable pieces of UI**.

Meaning:

* Buttons
* Inputs
* Cards
* Modals
* Headers
* Product cards
* Loaders
* Pagination UI
* Error messages

These are NOT pages.
They do NOT represent an entire screen.

Components live in:

```
src/components/
    Button.jsx
    Card.jsx
    Modal.jsx
    ProductCard.jsx
    Navbar.jsx
```

---

# 3. Why Separate Components and Pages?

Because:

1. Pages handle **routing**
2. Pages handle **data fetching**
3. Pages handle **business logic**
4. Components handle **presentation only**

Example:

### Wrong (beginner mistake)

Putting this inside ProductCard.jsx:

* API call
* Router navigation
* State
* Page layout

This makes the component unusable in other places.

### Correct (professional)

ProductPage handles:

* API call
* Pagination
* Sorting
* URL params
* Page layout

ProductCard handles only:

* Image
* Title
* Price
* Add to Cart button

# 4. Example Architecture

### Folder Structure:

```
src/
├── pages/
│   ├── HomePage.jsx
│   ├── ProductPage.jsx
│   ├── ProductDetailPage.jsx
│   └── CartPage.jsx
│
├── components/
│   ├── ProductCard.jsx
│   ├── Button.jsx
│   ├── Navbar.jsx
│   └── Loader.jsx
```

---

# 5. Example Code: Page vs Component

## Component: ProductCard.jsx

```jsx
export default function ProductCard({ product }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <img src={product.image} alt="" />
      <h3>{product.title}</h3>
      <p>{product.price}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

No API calls.
No routing.
Pure presentation.

---

## Page: ProductPage.jsx

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import ProductCard from "../components/ProductCard";

export default function ProductPage() {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://fakestoreapi.com/products")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setProducts(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Products</h2>

      <div className="grid">
        {products.map((p) => (
          <ProductCard key={p.id} product={p} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The page:

* Fetches product list
* Handles layout
* Uses ProductCard component

This is clean architecture.

---

# 6. Professional Rule

You NEVER import a page inside a component.

Correct flow:

Pages → use components
Components → do NOT use pages

---

# 7. Real-world analogy

Think of:

* Page = entire house
* Components = furniture inside the house

You don't put a house inside a chair.
But a house contains chairs.

---

# 8. Pages Should Do

* Fetch data
* Process data
* Connect with services
* Manage page state
* Handle routing (via useParams, search params)

---

# 9. Components Should Do

* Show UI
* Display data sent by parent
* Emit small actions (onClick, onChange)

They should contain almost **no business logic**.

---

# 10. Summary

You now understand:

Pages:

* Connected to routes
* Represent full screens
* Handle API calls and business logic

Components:

* Reusable UI blocks
* No routing
* No business logic
* Used inside pages

This separation is essential for clean, scalable React apps.

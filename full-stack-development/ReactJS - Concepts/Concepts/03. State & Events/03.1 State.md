# STATE

(Problem → Concept → Folder → Code → Explanation → Output)

---

## 1. Problem Without State

Without state, React components cannot remember or update data.

This causes:

* UI never changes after render
* No counters
* No form updates
* No toggles
* No dynamic behaviour

Example problem:
Clicking a button but the number never increases.

---

## 2. Core Concept

State is:

> Data that belongs to a component and can change over time.

React provides:

* `useState()` Hook
* Automatically re-renders UI when state changes

Key idea:
State change → Re-render → Updated UI

---

## 3. Real-World Intuition

Think of state as memory of a component.

If you press like button:
Likes go from 0 → 1 → 2
That changing value = state.

---

## 4. Folder Structure

```
src/
  components/
    StateDemo.jsx
  App.jsx
  main.jsx
```

---

## 5. Code Implementation

### A. State Example Component

**src/components/StateDemo.jsx**

```jsx
// StateDemo.jsx
// Demonstrates React state using useState hook.

import { useState } from "react";

function StateDemo() {

  // Creating state
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>State Example</h2>

      {/* Display current state */}
      <p>Count: {count}</p>

      {/* Update state on button click */}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increase Count
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default StateDemo;
```

---

### B. Using in App.jsx

**src/App.jsx**

```jsx
import StateDemo from "./components/StateDemo";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>State Concept</h1>
      <StateDemo />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

## 6. How State Works Internally

When React sees:

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

It creates:

* count → current value
* setCount → function to update value

Flow:

```
Click Button → setCount(1) → React re-renders → UI updates
```

---

## 7. Important State Rules

| Rule                         | Explanation       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Do NOT change state directly | ❌ count = 5       |
| Use setter function          | ✅ setCount(5)     |
| State is asynchronous        | Updates may batch |
| State triggers re-render     | Always updates UI |

---

## 8. What Happens on Button Click

1. Click triggers setCount
2. React schedules update
3. Component function re-runs
4. New JSX created
5. DOM updated only where needed

---

## 9. Output on Screen

State Concept

State Example
Count: 0
[Increase Count Button]

After 3 clicks:
Count: 3

---

## 10. Multiple State Example

```jsx
const [name, setName] = useState("Tanish");
const [age, setAge] = useState(21);
```

Each state is independent.

---

## 11. Why State Is Critical

| Problem        | State Solution      |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Static UI      | Dynamic UI          |
| No interaction | User driven updates |
| No memory      | Stateful logic      |
| Broken apps    | Real applications   |

---

## 12. Summary

| Concept | Explanation                |
| ------- | -------------------------- |
| State   | Dynamic component data     |
| Hook    | useState()                 |
| Purpose | Update UI based on changes |
| Result  | Interactive components     |
